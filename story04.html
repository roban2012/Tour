	<b><a name="T2">Summary</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

The Islamic Republic of Iran’s possible pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability presents a serious
challenge to U.S. interests in the Middle East. The U.S. strategy to dissuade Iran from
developing a nuclear weapons capability has relied heavily on international sanctions, in addition
to diplomatic engagement with the Islamic Republic.<br><br>
No other country is as critical in this effort as the People’s Republic of China. Winning
China’s cooperation on sanctions has been difficult, in large part due to the broad and deep
partnership between China and Iran. In the past decade, China has become Iran’s number one
trading partner. Collaboration between Beijing and Tehran centers on China’s energy needs
and Iran’s abundant resources but also includes significant non-energy economic ties, arms
sales and defense cooperation, and geostrategic balancing against the United States.
Understanding the nature and range of Chinese-Iranian cooperation is important to
crafting a successful U.S. strategy toward Iran. China’s policies have hampered U.S. and
international efforts to shape Iran’s decisions on its nuclear program, and continued Chinese-
Iranian cooperation will hinder U.S. attempts to pressure Iran.<br><br>
The United States has limited options to influence China’s relationship with Iran. Some
observers have proposed that the United States use positive inducements to reduce Chinese
cooperation with Iran, such as significantly enhancing bilateral relations with China or trading
key U.S. interests. However, these policy moves would involve costly trade-offs and are
probably politically unfeasible. The United States could also use negative inducements, such
as sanctions against Chinese firms, though such measures are also of limited use given China’s
economic power. A third approach has been to build a broad international sanctions coalition
against Iran, which has raised the diplomatic pressure on China to stop doing business with
Iran but increased Iran’s incentive to reach out to Beijing. While China may decrease business
ties with Iran, it will nevertheless continue to see Iran as a central actor shaping Chinese
interests in the Middle East. The increasing U.S.-Chinese competition in the Pacific region will
also have a direct impact on China’s willingness to cooperate with the United States on Iran.<br><br>
Nevertheless, China and Iran face divergent interests across a number of issues, which
could provide opportunities to contain their growing relationship. While some in China see
value in leveraging Iran to tie the U.S. down strategically, China is generally reluctant to
embrace Iran too tightly for fear of precipitating an open break in ties between China and the
United States. Many Iranians perceive China to be exploiting Iran economically while backing
an increasingly brutal and repressive regime.<br><br>
Finally, neither country is destined to remain an authoritarian state forever. Democratic
forces in either country could precipitate the emergence of regimes less hostile to the
United States-a more democratic Iran that may not pursue nuclear weapons or a China less

interested in balancing against the United States. Given that such changes may be far in the
future, the United States should continue to forestall an Iranian nuclear weapons capability
and pressure China to reduce ties to Iran.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T3">1. Introduction</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The Islamic Republic of Iran presents a serious challenge to U.S. interests in the Middle East.<br><br>
The sources of Washington’s discontent with Iran are numerous and include its sponsorship
of terrorism, its widespread human rights abuses, its leaders’ penchant for threatening U.S.
friends and allies in the Middle East, and its support of anti-American insurgents in Afghanistan.
The most important concern for U.S. policymakers, however, is Iran’s suspected pursuit
of a nuclear weapons capability. The United States and its allies have sought to dissuade Iran
from developing a nuclear weapons capability through a combination of sanctions and engagement.
Iran, however, continues to pursue uranium enrichment and is reported to be close to
developing the technologies necessary for producing nuclear weapons.<br><br>
The sanctions regime against Iran is heavily reliant on international actors, including
Russia, India, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and Turkey, each of which each maintains significant
commercial and financial ties with Iran. Winning China’s cooperation, however, may
be the most critical element of any U.S. effort to dissuade Iran from developing a nuclear weapons
capability.<br><br>
To date, China has been reluctant to support meaningful sanctions against Iran, in large
part because of the broad and deep partnership that the two countries have developed over
the past three decades. Collaboration between Beijing and Tehran centers on China’s energy
needs and Iran’s abundant resources but also includes significant non-energy economic ties,
arms sales and defense cooperation, and geostrategic balancing against the United States.1 For
the Iranian regime, no country in the world is as important in ensuring its survival and helping
to insulate it from international pressure as the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Despite
its drive for independence from foreign control, Iran has become heavily reliant on China economically,
diplomatically, and, to some extent, militarily.<br><br>
From Beijing’s perspective, Iran serves as an important strategic partner and point of
leverage against the United States. Iran possesses vast reserves of oil and natural gas that could
help fuel China’s development, and Iran is also a growing market for Chinese goods. Additionally,
an isolated Iran locked in conflict with the United States provides China with a unique


opportunity to expand its influence in the Middle East and could pin down the U.S. military
in the Persian Gulf so that it is harder to pivot toward the Pacific.2<br><br>
China’s view of and approach to Iran is rooted in part in its perceptions of the United
States as a geopolitical and military competitor. Though economically interdependent with the
United States, China is concerned about overall U.S. intentions toward it. More specifically,
China is anxious about the U.S. ability to dominate strategic global regions and/or choke off
China’s energy supplies in a potential military conflict, such as might break out over Taiwan.
Thus, a strong economic, diplomatic, and military partnership with the Islamic Republic helps
China offset U.S. power in the Middle East.<br><br>
Understanding the nature and range of Chinese-Iranian cooperation is important to
crafting a successful U.S. strategy toward Iran. China’s policies have hampered U.S. and international
efforts to shape Iran’s decisions on the nuclear program, and growing Chinese-Iranian
cooperation may further diminish U.S. attempts to pressure Iran. At the same time, the Chinese-
Iranian relationship is fraught with tensions and contradictions. China is reluctant to
embrace Iran too tightly, for fear of damaging not only its ties with the United States but also
its international reputation. Many Iranians perceive China to be exploiting Iran economically
while backing an increasingly brutal and repressive regime. The potential divergence of Chinese
and Iranian interests could eventually provide the United States with better opportunities
to contain and reverse China and Iran’s close cooperation.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T4">2. A Brief History of Iranian-Chinese Ties</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
China and Iran are the modern heirs to two ancient and proud civilizations, a fact that shapes
their interactions and colors their leaders’ senses of identity and place in the world today.3 Chinese
and Iranian views of the bilateral relationship tend to emphasize not only a shared sense
of cultural greatness, but also a joint sense of victimization by Western powers. Leaders in
both countries have embraced historical narratives that characterize the international system
as unjust and dominated by Western powers. Chinese and Iranian leaders strive to defend their
own regimes’ legitimacy in the face of an international system shaped by concepts of limited
sovereignty and the universality of human rights.4<br><br>
Once great powers, both China and Iran were reduced to semi-colonial states by the early
20th century. While Iran was effectively divided into “zones of influence” by Russia and Great
Britain in the 19th century, China experienced a series of painful military defeats by leading
Western powers. The Chinese communist regime, established by revolution in 1949, has been
under a variety of U.S.-led international sanctions for much of its existence. The United Kingdom and the United States compelled Iran to pursue Western interests from the early 1940s
onward, first by forcing Reza Pahlavi to step down from power in favor of his son Mohammad
Reza, and subsequently by carrying out a coup against the populist Iranian Prime Minister
Mohammed Mossadegh in 1953. As a consequence, many Iranians came to view Western
powers as responsible for all of the flaws and failings of the Pahlavi regime. During the same
period, U.S.-led sanctions against the communist regime in Beijing were used by China’s leaders
to portray the West as an enemy of the Chinese people.<br><br>
Iran’s relations with China were of little significance during the Pahlavi reign. Prior to
the 1979 revolution, relations with Beijing were kept to a minimum, in large part owing to
U.S. pressure on Iran to curtail economic and diplomatic ties with communist China. However,
before his overthrow, the Shah did seek to improve relations with China in order to
create a more independent foreign policy, and mutual concern over Soviet actions in Central,
South, Southeast, and East Asia drove Tehran and Beijing to take tentative steps toward greater
cooperation.<br><br>
However, the Islamic Republic that replaced the Shah was at first suspicious of Chinese
intentions and initially consigned China to the category of great powers that sought to exploit
Iran. Mao Zedong’s immediate successor as Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, Hua
Guofeng, was one of the last foreign officials to meet with the Shah before the collapse of his
regime, and Iran’s revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, was not inclined to
forgive such a transgression.5 PRC officials, however, immediately made substantial efforts to
reach out to the new Islamic Republic, extending it recognition only three days after its founding.
Gradually, Beijing was able to improve its relations with revolutionary Iran though skillful
diplomacy and the sale of arms during the Iran-Iraq War, earning Tehran’s gratitude for years
to come.<br><br>
Other factors contributed to growing Chinese-Iranian cooperation during the 1980s.<br><br>
First, Beijing dropped its support for revolutionary communism during this period, and therefore
posed little ideological threat to the Islamic Republic, which was itself battling leftist forces
in the early years of the revolution. Second, Iran’s radical revolutionary policies isolated it from
the rest of the world, including the United States and the Soviet Union as well as much of the
Arab world, a position that the PRC could empathize with to some extent, having itself been at
odds with both Washington and Moscow during most of the 1960s. Furthermore, the regimes
in both China and Iran took power through violent revolutions against pro-American regimes,
and both regimes strongly opposed Western “domination” of the international system.<br><br>
China, a net oil exporter in the 1980s, viewed its relationship with Iran as a way to
increase its influence in a geostrategically important region dominated by the United States.<br><br>
Additionally, Iran was useful to Beijing as an export opportunity for Chinese arms at a
time of stagnant Chinese military procurement budgets. From Tehran’s perspective, despite
Khomeini’s proclaimed intent to pursue a foreign policy that was “neither West nor East,”
practical considerations, most notably Iran’s isolation and its war with Iraq, eventually drove
Tehran to accept limited cooperation with Beijing so long as this did not entail any concessions
on core domestic and foreign policies. As time would show, China was in many ways an ideal
foreign partner for the Islamic Republic-it had never held territorial ambitions in Iran, unlike
other great powers, such as Russia and the United Kingdom; it was willing to provide Iran with technologies that the rest of the world would not sell the regime; and it was willing to ignore
Iran’s provocative actions abroad and its human rights abuses at home.<br><br>
The Chinese-Iranian relationship moved into a new phase as the 1980s drew to a close
and important changes occurred in both countries. For Iran, the Iran-Iraq war’s end in 1988
was followed in 1989 by the death of Khomeini and the assumption of power by Supreme
Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Meanwhile,
China’s crushing of the pro-democracy protests at Tiananmen Square in June 1989 would
have near- and long-term effects on its foreign and domestic policy. Both countries’ foreign and
domestic policies became somewhat more pragmatic during these years, moving away from
dogmatic revolutionary goals toward economic reconstruction and military modernization,
and both countries remained isolated by the United States and its partners. As a consequence,
Iran and China came to cooperate more deeply on arms and energy issues during this period.<br><br>
They also deepened diplomatic cooperation to resist U.S. and Western pressures to improve
human rights and democratic freedoms in both countries. Iran’s support for China’s suppression
of the pro-democracy movement in June 1989 helped strengthen relations.<br><br>
From 1992 onward, Chinese Communist Party General-Secretary Jiang Zemin presided
over the acceleration of the growth rate of the Chinese economy. As China’s economy boomed,
the PRC moved from being a net oil exporter to being a net importer in 1993, a development
that greatly raised Iran’s significance to China. At the same time, the United States pursued
a policy of “dual containment” against Iran and Iraq. Iran’s increasing isolation and China’s
growing need for energy and stronger international partnerships brought the two countries
closer together.<br><br>
Over the same period, however, the U.S. and China relationship repeatedly veered close
to open confrontation, culminating in a showdown over security in the Taiwan Strait in 1996.<br><br>
Chinese leaders realized that a clean break with the United States would carry potentially
disastrous consequences for the PRC. Recognizing that Chinese military assistance to Iran
was further aggravating China’s relationship with the United States and putting China’s aim
of continued rapid economic growth at risk, the Chinese leadership decided in 1997 to significantly
downgrade relations between Tehran and Beijing. As a result, the PRC ceased open
cooperation in important areas, such as the nuclear and missile programs.6<br><br>
But four developments in the late 1990s and early 2000s opened up new opportunities
and incentives for China to resume high-level cooperation with the Iran. First, Jiang Zemin
successfully consolidated his grip on power in 1997, in part through his skillful management
of China’s relationship with the United States; thereafter, he could afford to worry less about
tensions with the United States over Chinese ties to Iran disrupting his control. In spring 1999,
the mistaken U.S. air strike on China’s embassy in Belgrade led to popular and elite pressures
on the Chinese leadership to distance itself from the United States, making cooperation with
the Islamic Republic a popular way to show China’s indifference to U.S. concerns. Then, in
late 2001, China’s accession to the World Trade Organization removed a source of U.S. leverage
over China regarding Iran, as the United States could previously threaten to block China’s
accession to the global trading body if it cooperated with Iran. Finally, after the discovery of
Iran’s secret uranium enrichment program in 2002, Western companies began to withdraw
from Iran and Western governments began to ramp up pressure on the Islamic Republic, opening up new opportunities for Chinese firms and diplomats to build economic and strategic ties
to Tehran.<br><br>
Thus, in the early 2000s, Chinese-Iranian relations began maturing into their present
form. U.S. pressure on Russia, Japan, South Korea, India, and Europe to reduce trade and
investment with Iran over its nuclear program gave China a freer hand to become involved in
Iran’s underserved domestic market and develop its energy resources. Under the new leadership
of Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, China de-emphasized the relatively warmer relations with the
United States and the West that had characterized the Jiang Zemin years in favor of emphasizing
such goals as internal stability and social “harmony.” The new Chinese leadership also pursued
an economic policy of “going out,” which focused on encouraging investments in global
energy and mining industries. Chinese trade and investment ties with Iran expanded so greatly
in this period that by 2007 China had become Iran’s number one trading partner.<br><br>

A strong relationship with China appeals to Iran for several reasons.<br><br>
First and foremost, the Iranian regime views China as a potential ally against its chief
nemesis, the United States. Opposition to American “hegemony” is an ideological pillar of the
Islamic Republic. This is reflected not just in the regime’s propaganda but also in Iran’s foreign
policies, which include support for Hizballah, HAMAS, and various insurgent groups in Iraq
and Afghanistan. The Islamic Republic has had some success in establishing itself as a regional
power, particularly in Iraq and the Levant. However, it has not succeeded in its main objective
of supplanting the United States as the premier power in the Middle East. Iran is especially
anxious about the U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf, which Iran views as its rightful
sphere of influence. However, Iran does not possess the economic and military might necessary
to realize its ambitions on its own. It is also constrained by other regional powers, such as Saudi
Arabia, Turkey, and Israel. And, unlike these countries, Iran lacks a powerful external ally.<br><br>
Iran hopes that China will potentially tip the balance in its favor. Iranian officials, unlike
their Chinese counterparts, are not reluctant to explicitly emphasize the strategic nature of
the partnership. According to Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi, “Tehran-Beijing
ties are strategic and their prospects are bright.”7 Indeed, Tehran views China as an emerging
economic, political, and military power that can offset U.S. power globally and in the Middle
East specifically. Moreover, Iranian officials appear to believe that China’s interests are closely
“tied” to Iran.8<br><br>
Iran also views China as a strong economic partner and a crucial provider of the investment
and technology necessary for Iran’s economic development and modernization. Faced
with U.S. and international sanctions, Iran lacks access to foreign capital and expertise to
develop its declining energy sector.<br><br>
To a considerable extent, the Islamic Republic has become dependent on China as the
regime’s chief diplomatic protector in the face of internal and external pressures. In contrast
to Western powers, China is unconcerned with the Iranian regime’s internal behavior. The regime’s brutal suppression of the 2009 protest movement and its wider human rights abuses
were met with silence from Beijing; China may have even provided active assistance in monitoring
and suppressing Iranian opposition forces (through the provision of telecommunications
tracking technology and crowd control devices).9<br><br>
Obtaining the patronage of an extra-regional power is somewhat psychologically humbling
for Iran, whose leaders proudly describe the Islamic Republic as an independent power
not beholden to other countries. Nonetheless, over time, diplomatic, economic, and military
pressures have forced the Iranian regime to become more dependent on assistance rendered by
China.<br><br>
For a long time, Russia was one of Iran’s chief foreign partners. It sold advanced weapons
to Iran, helped develop its nuclear industry, and shielded the Islamic Republic from harsh UN
sanctions through its vote in the Security Council. But ties between Iran and Russia became
severely strained after the Russian vote for UN Security Council Resolution 1929 in 2010
and its refusal to sell Iran its advanced S-300 air defense system. Iran’s relations with Russia
were based on expediency rather than shared strategic interests. After all, Russia was one of
the imperial powers that sought to dominate Iran in the 19th and 20th centuries, and the two
countries compete for influence in Central Asia and the Caspian Sea region. Hence Russia
appears to view Iran as more of a convenient point of leverage vis-à-vis the United States, or
even a regional competitor, rather than a true strategic partner. From Iran’s perspective, the
Russian leadership may be all too willing to trade Iran’s interests in return for concessions from
the United States.<br><br>
Iran’s failure to achieve its strategic goals though cooperation with Russia leave it with
three other potential non-Western partners: India, Brazil, and China. India and Iran maintain
cordial relations, but from Tehran’s perspective, Indian interests are too closely aligned
with those of the United States on important issues for New Delhi to support Tehran against
Washington. Brazil may emerge as a more independent geopolitical actor, as demonstrated by
its brokering of the ultimately unsuccessful nuclear swap deal in 2010, but, at least in the near
term, Brazil lacks the economic, military, geopolitical heft, and view of the United States best
suited to Iranian needs.<br><br>
Thus, China is the most plausible large foreign patron for the Iranian regime, and in
many ways an ideal one-China is powerful, prosperous, and makes few demands of Iran
regarding its internal politics or its external activities in the wider Middle East. Iran, perhaps
unrealistically, seems to hope that China can even serve as a true strategic partner that, unlike
Russia, will not trade its relationship with Iran for its own interests vis-a-vis the United States.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T6">4. Iran’s Military Modernization Has Been Facilitated by China</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
China has aided Iran’s efforts to modernize its military hardware and doctrine. As noted previously,
the PRC was an essential provider of military hardware during Iran’s eight-year struggle
with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. Iran’s rupture with the United States severely impeded its ability
to conduct its war with Iraq, while the Soviet Union and such major Western powers as France supplied Baghdad with military hardware while refusing similar assistance to Iran. Chinese
military sales to Iran were often provided indirectly and discreetly through third-party sale/
transfers carried out via countries such as North Korea, but they were recognized by Tehran as
a critical form of support.10<br><br>
China not only sold Iran small arms; it also supplied Iran with tactical ballistic and antiship
cruise missiles. Indeed, Iran’s use of Silkworm missiles against Kuwaiti shipping in 1987
became a significant source of tension between China and the United States.11 China eventually
agreed to stop sales of the Silkworm and the more sophisticated C-802 missiles to Iran.12<br><br>
But instead of directly selling missiles to Iran, China played a crucial role in starting
up Iran’s indigenous military-industrial sector, greatly helping Iran’s military modernization
efforts. Chinese design and technology can be seen in many Iranian missile series, from the
short-range Oghab and Nazeat missiles to the long-range Shahab 3.13 In addition, Iran has
developed its own relatively sophisticated antiship cruise missiles with Chinese help. These
include the Nasr, which is reported as being nearly identical to the Chinese C-704. According
to some reports, China even helped Iran establish a plant for the manufacture of the Nasr in
2010.14 China is also reported to have provided Iran with advanced antiship mines and fastattack
boats.15 The total value of these transfers is difficult to know for certain but has been
estimated by some analysts to range from a low of $4 billion to possibly as high as $10 billion.16<br><br>
Such transfers of weapons and technological know-how have continued despite international
sanctions, with one observer reporting allegations that Chinese arms suppliers have
agreed to deliver weapon systems with the serial numbers filed off so as to obscure their origin.
17 In some cases, China is suspected of transferring ballistic missile technology to Iran via
North Korea.18 Even more troubling are allegations that Chinese and Iranian defense cooperation
has also extended to covertly developing Iran’s chemical weapons program.19<br><br>
Iran’s ballistic missiles and naval capabilities form the core of its military doctrine visa-
vis the United States. Lacking an advanced air force, Iran aims to project military power
through the use of its missile forces, which can be used to deter the United States or retaliate
against the United States or its regional allies in the event of a military conflict. Additionally,
Iran’s naval capabilities can be used to disrupt shipping in the Persian Gulf, potentially inflicting
pressure on the United States to end any future military conflict on terms favorable to Iran. <br><br>

	<b><a name="T7">5. China Helped Start Iran’s Nuclear Program</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
China has assisted in the development of Iran’s nuclear program. Most of this assistance has
been, in principle, geared toward the civilian aspect of the program. However, much of what
China has actually provided, including support on uranium enrichment, has a military dimension
as well. For example, from 1985 to 1996, China provided Iran with various types of critical
nuclear technology and machinery and helped to acquire others, assisted Iran in uranium
exploration and mining, and helped Iran master the uses of lasers for uranium enrichment.20<br><br>
In particular, Chinese technicians and engineers played an important role in training Iranian
nuclear engineers and in establishing the Esfahan Nuclear Research Center, which has played
a central role in the development of Iran’s nuclear program.21<br><br>
It is not clear whether Chinese aid was provided with the express aim of helping Iran to
develop a nuclear weapons capability-the Chinese firms involved, and the Chinese government
itself, may have been motivated more by profits and better relations with the Islamic
Republic than by strategic considerations. But the effect has been to assist Iran’s acquisition of
such capabilities.<br><br>
China stopped providing direct nuclear support to Iran in 1997 as part of an effort to
improve ties with the United States and win assistance with its own civilian nuclear program.22
Beijing’s decision caused a good deal of friction in its relationship with Iran, but China’s earlier
nuclear assistance and sanctions-busting by Chinese firms likely helped Iran make substantial
progress toward a functioning nuclear program.<br><br>
A functioning nuclear weapons capability could allow Iran to significantly affect the balance
of power in the Persian Gulf by potentially neutralizing the U.S. conventional military
superiority, dissuading the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) from hosting U.S. forces, and
potentially establishing Iran as the “hegemon” of the Persian Gulf. As will be discussed below,
because some Chinese political elites view a more powerful Iran as serving Chinese interests
in the Middle East, China has both provided material and diplomatic support to the Iranian
nuclear program.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T8">6. China Has Shielded Iran from the Effects of International Sanctions</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Such support has been particularly appreciated by Iran, given its growing international isolation.
Iran has been put under four rounds of UN Security Council sanctions in addition to unilateral U.S. sanctions, all of which have deeply affected Iran’s shipping, energy industry,
and its financial system.23<br><br>
However, 2011 legislation by the U.S. Congress targeting Iran’s Central Bank has inflicted
the greatest damage on Iran’s economy. Any foreign company or country that deals with the
Iranian Central Bank, which serves as a clearinghouse for Iran’s oil sales, could be barred from
the U.S. financial system. As a result, many of Iran’s major oil customers are reducing purchases
of Iranian oil. Japan, South Korea, the European Union, and perhaps even China have
sought additional oil from the GCC states.24 The United States hopes that GCC oil can slowly
replace Iranian oil in the market without a substantial increase in oil prices.<br><br>
Iranian leaders reacted to impending sanctions against the Central Bank with alarm.
Iran’s currency, the rial, depreciated as soon as sanctions were passed by the U.S. Congress,
substantially raising the cost of everyday goods within Iran.25 Sanctions may not have dissuaded
the Iranian government from continuing the nuclear program, but they have clearly
increased the costs for the regime of continuing its pursuit of uranium enrichment. Stronger
sanctions on Iran may yet impact its nuclear decisionmaking.26<br><br>
To date, Iran has been able to rely on China as a shield against sanctions over its nuclear
program. This is especially true of the three rounds of sanctions preceding UN Security Council
Resolution 1929. Indeed, shortly after the passage of each UN resolution, China has accelerated
and expanded its economic ties with Tehran. The writings of a number of Chinese foreign
policy analysts suggest that this is a deliberate strategy by Beijing to help Tehran weather international
condemnation while expanding China’s influence in the country. One analyst argues
that China’s strategy, when confronted with overwhelming international pressure to support
sanctions such as UN Security Council Resolution 1929, should be to “cast a supporting
vote . . . but [then] shift towards a more passive position.”27 Through its economic cooperation
and deal-making with China, including a barter agreement designed to facilitate trade despite
sanctions against banks doing business with Iran, Iran has blunted the impact of the international
sanctions regime on the country. The impact of sanctions against the Central Bank
and Iran’s expulsion from the global financial system is therefore strongly affected by China’s
decisions.28<br><br>

	<b><a name="T9">7. China Is Iran’s Biggest Economic Partner</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Energy Cooperation<br><br>
The foundations of the economic partnership between Iran and China are Iran’s abundant
energy resources and China’s growing energy needs. Over the past several years, China has
become Iran’s biggest oil customer and biggest economic partner.29<br><br>
Indeed, according to an Iranian official, 166 Chinese companies attended Iran’s Oil Show
in 2011, as opposed to 100 Chinese firms in 2010, making the Chinese the most numerous
foreign participants in this international commercial exhibition.30 Iran has also formed a joint
oil and gas committee with China to broaden and expedite energy cooperation.31 Furthermore,
China signed a $20 billion agreement in May 2011 to boost bilateral cooperation in Iran’s
industrial and mining sectors, and the leaders of the two countries have announced plans to
more than double their annual bilateral trade, currently around $30C$40 billion, to $100 billion
by 2016.32<br><br>
In addition to purchasing Iranian oil and natural gas, China is also the most important
foreign player in Iranian “upstream” (exploration and extraction) operations. China is currently
slated to develop the giant Azadegan and Yadavaran oil and natural gas fields.33 Japan
had been designated by Tehran as its preferred foreign investor in Azadegan, but Tokyo withdrew
from the deal due to U.S. pressure.<br><br>
U.S. pressure on Iran has resulted in not just Japan but also many other Asian and European
countries abandoning their investments in Iran. Although Iran is believed to hold the
world’s second-largest natural gas reserves, it lacks the technology and know-how to exploit
these vast resources on its own. China has helped to fill the void created by the departure of
Asian and European energy companies by agreeing to develop the giant South Pars field.34<br><br>
In addition to the South Pars field, China has expressed an interest in helping Iran develop
its heavy oil fields.35 Heavy crude is harder to produce, refine, and sell than light crude oil,
which has a lower density. Sixty percent of Iran’s oil reserves are thought to be of the heavy
crude variety.36 The PRC has also become Iran’s largest market for petrochemical exports, especially
methanol.37 According to Reza Hamzelou, the head of Iran’s Petrochemical Commercial
Company, Iran has surpassed Saudi Arabia as the biggest methanol exporter to China, and Chinese companies are currently negotiating the construction of a $5 billion methanol plant
in the Iranian city of Mahshahr.38<br><br>
Until recently, the Islamic Republic did not have the refining capability to meet domestic
fuel demands and was forced to import as much as 40 percent of its fuel needs.39 This made
Iran particularly vulnerable to sanctions targeting refined fuel imports, prompting the government
to vigorously expand its refining capacity. China has assisted the regime’s objectives by
not only increasing fuel shipments through companies such as Zhuhai Zhenrong,40 but also
helping Iran expand its refining capacity.41 It appears that these efforts by China and Iran may
have paid off: The Iranian government has recently claimed that it no longer imports any fuel
from China or any other country and is even capable of exporting fuel.42 Even if not entirely
true, Iran could now be less vulnerable to sanctions on fuel imports than it was just a few years
ago, thanks in part to Chinese assistance.43<br><br>
Infrastructure Development<br><br>
Iran’s economic reliance on China is not limited to the energy sector. In fact, non-energy trade
and investments form a substantial component of bilateral economic ties. In the past two
decades, Chinese engineers have built bridges, dams, railroads, and tunnels throughout Iran.
For example, China’s Sinohydro Corp. signed an agreement with Iran to build the world’s tallest
dam in the western province of Lorestan.44 This dam, along with several others that are
planned, will help Iran expand its domestic energy supplies, potentially allowing it to sell more
oil on the international market.<br><br>
China is also developing Iran’s rail network, helping it become more integrated into
regional markets. Iran and China are reportedly considering a plan to build a railroad that will
connect the western Chinese province of Xinjiang to Iran through Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and
Afghanistan. If completed, the railroad may eventually link to a wider rail network that may
include Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and Europe, though this seems less likely given the instability in
countries such as Syria and Iraq.45<br><br>
The Tehran metro system, completed in sections between 2000 and 2006, is probably
China’s showpiece infrastructure development project in Iran. The metro system would have
been difficult for Iran to build without Chinese assistance. Crucial Western technology (the
braking system, for example) was initially obtained by Chinese companies and used in the Tehran metro system.46 China is currently financing $1 billion worth of city improvement
projects in Tehran, including the expansion of its subway and highway system. Such foreign
investments, according to Tehran’s municipal finance director, are “unprecedented” in the
city’s history.47 The northeastern Iranian city of Mashhad has also started to operate its own
metro system built with Chinese assistance.48<br><br>
The Effects of Sanctions on Chinese-Iranian Economic Cooperation
Despite the PRC’s expansive economic relationship with Iran, in late 2011 China’s official
media expressed anxiety that “contention . . . over the Iranian nuclear issue has reached white
hot levels and could even be on the precipice of a showdown.”49 Major Chinese firms, such as
CNPC, Sinopec, CNOOC, and Zhenrong, have failed to implement their agreements with
Iran or have “gone slow” with those agreements, possibly due to the U.S. agreement to not to
sanction those firms for their 2008C2009 investments with Iran over the near term if they
forgo new investment deals.50<br><br>
Still, it is not clear that these are long-term moves driven by any change in assessment in
Beijing about the wisdom of cooperating with an Iran that is seeking a nuclear weapons capability.
Rather than indicating a central government decision to cease or reduce cooperation
with Iran, such moves are probably better understood as either firm-level decisions or tactical
moves to reduce the kinds of risks that saw China potentially lose its $18.8 billion in investments
in Libya when that country democratized.51 If this analysis is correct, it is likely that
if the current tensions between Iran and the West subside, Chinese state-owned firms will
quickly resume their investments in Iran, and the PRC will strive to build an even stronger
economic partnership with the Islamic Republic. In the meantime, China is helping keep the
Iranian economy afloat by using a barter system to trade Iranian oil for its goods and services,
helping Tehran bypass U.S. sanctions.52 China also appears to be taking advantage of the EU
embargo against Iran to receive significant discounts on Iranian oil.53 This may cause some
tensions between the two countries in the short term, but an increasingly isolated Iran may
have no other choice but to become even more dependent on China as an economic partner.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T10">8. The Iranian Regime Depends on China for Survival</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
China’s strong economic, military, and diplomatic relations with Iran are attributable mostly to
two key factors: (1) Iran’s growing international isolation, especially from the West, and (2) the 
authoritarian nature of both the Iranian and Chinese regimes. The relationship between the
two countries, however, is hardly equal, with China enjoying a more advantageous position.<br><br>
Over time, Iran’s relationship with China has changed from one of mutual cooperation
in the 1980s into one of lopsided dependence today. China views Iran as a potential partner
for limiting U.S. influence in the Middle East, but it is not overwhelmingly dependent on
the Islamic Republic for its energy needs (sourcing 11 percent of its imported oil from Iran
in 201154), economic development, or overall national security. Moreover, the PRC purchases
oil and natural gas from other Middle Eastern energy producers such as Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates, and depends on its vibrant economic ties with the United States to
maintain its growth.<br><br>
Iran, on the other hand, is locked in a bitter conflict with the United States, and it faces
growing geopolitical competition with Saudi Arabia and the GCC. With only a small number
of allies, the Islamic Republic has come to depend increasingly on China for critical diplomatic,
economic, military, and technological support. China has now become the Iranian
regime’s main external protector.<br><br>
The Islamic Republic’s potential wariness of dependence on a foreign power such as China
is somewhat offset by the authoritarian nature of the Chinese regime, which shares Iran’s resistance
to Western pressures for political liberalization and democratization. The Iranian regime
believes Western conceptions of democracy to be a direct threat to its hold on power. From
the regime’s perspective, Western powers have promoted democracy in Iran in order to weaken
the Islamic Republic; the opposition Green Movement is often portrayed as Western lackeys
engaged in “sedition” rather than a genuine democratic movement. The Islamic Republic
knows that China harbors similar fears about democracy, making it a reliable partner in resisting
Western criticism over Iranian human rights abuses.<br><br>
Tehran perceives China as a much less meddlesome foreign power than the European
nations or the United States. China and Iran have never been at war, and China has never
expressed any imperial ambitions in Iran. Moreover, China does not border Iran and is thus
a relatively safe external patron. However, depending on how it handles its relationship with
Iran, China could, given the right circumstances, come to be seen as exploiting Tehran’s vulnerability,
especially if the Islamic Republic becomes increasingly isolated and prone to internal
discord and disunity. Iranian perceptions of China as a non-imperialist power are largely
based on a history of limited interaction between the two nations. But if China seeks to shape
the domestic character of the regime, or is perceived to be leveraging Iran’s vulnerability to
extract concessions on investment opportunities or gets into a dispute with Iran over energy
import contract prices,55 Iranians could begin to see China as an exploitive country in the same
vein as previous imperial powers.<br><br>
An example of such potential Chinese interference in Iranian domestic politics may have
been foreshadowed in the aftermath of the 2009 Iranian presidential election. The election,
perceived by many Iranians as fraudulent, gave rise to the opposition Green Movement and
anti-regime protests by millions of Iranians. Many of the demonstrators specifically blamed
China for supporting and maintaining the regime. China has been accused of providing antiriot
equipment used to suppress opposition protestors and selling technology that enabled the regime to track dissidents’ movements.56 Most notably, regime supporters’ chants of “death to
America” were often countered by opposition cries of “death to China.”57 These events demonstrated
the extent of anti-Chinese sentiment among urban and pro-democracy elements of the
Iranian population, who may come to dominate Iranian politics in the future.<br><br>
Resentment against China is also reflected in other sectors of Iranian society, especially
the clergy. Shortly after the outbreak of the Green Movement in Iran, riots broke out in
China’s Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region in July 2009, leading high-ranking Iranian clerics
to criticize China for its treatment of the Muslim Uighurs. Ayatollah Yousef Sanei, one of
the highest-ranking clerics in Iran and in many ways the spiritual leader of the reform movement,
described China’s response to the riots as “inhumane and harsh.”58 To be sure, Sanei’s
motivations were not purely religious in nature; avowedly opposed to President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad’s government, Sanei’s views may have represented the deep unease felt by the
reformists toward China’s support for Iran’s authoritarian regime. But China was also criticized
by conservative and pro-regime clerics such as Ayatollah Makarem Shirazi and Ayatollah
Nouri Hamedani, both of whom condemned China’s treatment of the Uighurs and called for
a strong stance from the Iranian government.59<br><br>
It is not clear whether core elements of the Iranian regime, including Supreme Leader
Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guards, harbor serious concerns regarding Iran’s relationship
with China or not. But even as it maintains close economic and military ties with China,
the Islamic Republic remains sensitive and politically vulnerable to any sort of foreign “interference”
in its affairs.<br><br>
Looking to the future, significant sections of the Iranian population and even some elements
of the elite appear increasingly inclined to view China as a malign influence. In particular,
the Green Movement and reformists view China as the protector and enabler of the
regime’s most hardline elements, which could pose challenges for the Chinese-Iranian relationship
if Iran becomes more democratic in the future. <br><br>

	<b><a name="T11">9. China’s National Interests and Its Policies Toward Iran</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
	Many countries are wary of Iran’s nuclear activities and assertive foreign policies but at the
same time attracted to its abundant energy resources and economic potential. Yet few have
been as bold as China in seizing these latter opportunities. As a result, China is in the paradoxical
position of having more leverage than almost any other country vis-à-vis Iran, but also
having the most to lose should more broadly punitive sanctions be imposed or war break out,
a fact not lost on Chinese analysts and policymakers.60 Additionally, some Chinese analysts
warn about the risks for Chinese interests of unduly antagonizing Iran, given what they see as Iran’s influence in the Middle East, Central and South Asia, and the Organization of the
Islamic Conference.61<br><br>
Still, China’s relations with Iran are primarily shaped by its economic interests, particularly
its expanding energy needs. Additionally, China’s policy toward Iran is deeply influenced
by the PRC’s perceived rivalry with the United States, based on the suspicions of many Chinese
decisionmakers that the United States seeks to block China’s rise to great-power status,
balanced against China’s dependence on maintaining a stable economic relationship with the
United States.<br><br>
For much of the past decade, scholars of Chinese foreign policy have noted a gradual
expansion in the number of players whose views of the United States and China’s “ascent”
affect China’s overall external relations.62 In a recent and influential work, Linda Jakobson
and Dean Knox have updated this general finding by describing a host of new actors, including
the Chinese military and state-owned enterprises (most notably financial institutions and
energy companies).63 With respect to China taking a more proactive role in sanctioning Iran,
Jakobson and Knox note that the “mainstream view among both old and new actors is that
calls by industrialized countries to contribute to global public goods are an attempt to slow
China’s ascent.”64 They also warn that large numbers of the Chinese elite “would like China to
more vigorously defend its right to set conditions when others-usually Western states-seek
China’s cooperation on initiatives such as sanctioning Iran.”65<br><br>
Picking up on the importance of such increasingly “open discourse in a constrained environment,”
David Shambaugh has described “the center of gravity on the Chinese spectrum”
of foreign policy voices as lying not with those who favor greater cooperation with the West,
but instead with “Realists” and hyper-nationalistic and strongly anti-American “Nativists.”
Advocates emphasizing cooperation with the United States and other major powers are seen
to be losing influence, and the general trend with respect to addressing leading international
problems is to contribute “only as much to global governance as is necessary to deflect Western
criticism,” since “there is a virtual consensus across the spectrum [of PRC foreign policy analysis]
that the whole concept of global governance is a Western trap which tries to undermine
China’s sovereignty and lure it into a variety of foreign entanglements where China does not
belong.”66<br><br>
If these analyses are correct, then it seems reasonable to conclude that, at present, when
it comes to China’s policy toward Iran, the forces inside Chinese policymaking circles who
emphasize strategic and economic concerns are likely to exert a strong influence, perhaps even greater than those who focus primarily on diplomatic cooperation with the United States on
issues of nonproliferation and economic development. Still, Chinese foreign policy in recent
years has tacked back and forth between a greater assertiveness and a continuing emphasis on
cooperation, owing to the continuing influence of those who point to Beijing’s need to maintain
a stable, if cool, relationship with the United States to ensure China’s continued growth.<br><br>
In seeking to gauge U.S. influence on China, it is useful to have some comparative perspective
about Iran’s value to China, relative to the United States’, as a destination for Chinese
investment and trade. Through October 2011, total bilateral Chinese-Iranian trade amounted
to approximately $39 billion.67 The PRC’s new investments in the Islamic Republic reportedly
totaled roughly $1 billion in 2011, though figures are hard to come by and the Iranian regime
is widely suspected of deliberately seeking to exaggerate the size of Chinese investments for
political purposes, a phenomenon that has led one observer to describe PRC investment in Iran
as “one step forward, two steps back.”68 By contrast, through the third quarter of 2011, Chinese
investments in the United States amounted to approximately $15.9 billion,69 while U.S.<br><br>
imports from China reached approximately $330 billion through October 2011.70 Finally, in
the energy sector, over the past two years, the Chinese firms CNOOC and Sinopec have purchased
more than $4.6 billion worth of energy assets in the United States, giving these firms
an incentive not to put their U.S. investments at risk by cooperating with Iran in ways that
earn Washington’s ire.71<br><br>
Additionally, China is entering a political transition year in 2012, and during such times
Beijing’s top leadership is widely believed to favor downplaying confrontation and ensuring
that foreign policy issues do not intrude into leadership succession debates. As such, those
who favor prioritizing cooperation with the United States may, at least temporarily, succeed in
downplaying relations with Iran in order to prevent tensions with Washington over Iran from
disrupting the political handover from Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao to their successors. <br><br>

	<br>
	<b><a name="T12">10. China Views Iran as a Secure Source of Energy</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
China’s need for energy is one of the most important factors shaping Chinese-Iranian relations.
72 Ever since China’s rapid economic growth began in the early 1990s, the Chinese leadership’s
goal has been to secure the energy needed to fuel China’s economy. As Figure 10.1
shows, China’s oil consumption exceeded indigenous production capacity for the 16 years
between 1993 and 2009. As shown in Figure 10.2, China’s dependency on imported oil surpassed
50 percent of its total oil demand in 2009. This trend has continued since 2009.<br><br>


For Beijing, investing in Iran’s energy sector appears to represent the promise of a secure
oil supply for years to come. In addition, China’s investments in Iran have not only led to
profitable contracts for the PRC’s three major national oil companies (China National Petroleum
Corporation, Sinopec, and China National Off-Shore Oil Corporation) but have also
potentially enhanced Chinese energy security by developing a solid relationship with a supplier
unlikely to be intimidated into cutting oil exports to China in the event of a U.S.-Chinese
military conflict.73<br><br>
As noted previously, non-energy commercial ties between China and Iran are also important
for the bilateral relationship. For example, Chinese involvement in developing Iranian
infrastructure has ranged from building the Tehran metro to investment in mining operations
to dam construction and port development, as well as commercial ship-building and sale of
consumer goods.74 Non-energy trade and investment serve as a major incentive for Beijing to
expand relations with Iran, as they provide opportunities for Chinese state-owned enterprises
to win foreign contracts and sell their goods abroad, while helping provide jobs for Chinese
labor. From 1985 to 1997, civilian nuclear power cooperation was also a major element of the
relationship, which helped China to earn substantial profits that enabled it modernize its own
nuclear power infrastructure.75<br><br>

	<br>
	<b><a name="T13">11. China Views Iran as Countering U.S. Power in the Middle East</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
China has also pursued significant military and defense relations with Iran. From the Chinese
perspective, there is strategic value in helping Iran develop enough military capabilities
to counter U.S. dominance of the Persian Gulf. The U.S. alliance with the GCC has ensured
a security regime consistent with U.S. interests in the Middle East. However, the Persian Gulf
is not fully and securely within the U.S. orbit as long as the Islamic Republic opposes the U.S.
presence in the region. An Iran equipped with relatively advanced military hardware contributes
to the Chinese objective of preventing the domination of this geostrategically important
region by the United States while helping to keep the U.S. focus away from the Pacific region.
Furthermore, by supplying Iran with weapons such as antiship cruise missiles, China
gains an opportunity to field-test hardware and concepts of operations that it might one day
use itself in a conflict with the United States.76 The United States, in turn, has developed an
updated AirSea Battle Concept (ASBC) for responding to anti-access/area denial capabilities
(A2/AD) such as those fielded by China and Iran; if a conflict between the United States and
Iran ever came to pass, China would be able to use it to gauge how the U.S. ASBC would work
in practice.<br><br>
While some observers have speculated that China may eventually establish a formal
defense relationship with Iran, perhaps with an eye toward leasing naval facilities that could
help the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN)’s secure the sea lanes used by China to obtain energy from the Middle East, this seems unlikely, at least for the foreseeable future.77 At present,
China has no formal overseas military installations and has stated that it will not seek
such, though some People’s Liberation Army (PLA) analysts and officers have begun debating
the need for such facilities if China’s military power is to ever match its economic standing.78<br><br>
Still, it is difficult to imagine a formal, legal, and publicly acknowledged Chinese-Iranian
defense alliance, given the negative implications such an arrangement would likely entail for
China’s relations with the United States, the Arab world, and Israel.<br><br>
Many Chinese analysts nonetheless favor maintaining close relations with the Islamic
Republic, partly based on their belief that Iran will view China’s rise as a nonthreatening
development and will seek to support it. These analysts also tend to believe that a Middle
East dominated by Iran could benefit Chinese national interests. Chinese-Iranian geopolitical
cooperation could, of course, continue to grow in the future even if the two countries never
sign a formal mutual defense treaty. Such cooperation may be specifically aimed at countering
what both perceive to be U.S. “hegemony.” As one Chinese analyst has argued,
as our country’s overall national strength continues to increase and as the trend of [our]
peaceful rise grows ever stronger, Sino-Iranian relations can begin to tilt ever more in a
strategic direction, seeking to raise our political influence and efficacy in international
affairs through the strengthening of our relations with Iran, with the ultimate goal being
to find the appropriate balance between practical outcomes and strategic aims.79<br><br>
Thus, even while recognizing the inherent limits of the relationship, such analysts perceive ties
with Iran as contributing materially to the growth of China’s overall influence and strategic
weight in international affairs.<br><br>
At the same time, Chinese analysts also express the belief that it is essential to avoid
antagonizing Iran. Were China to get into a political disagreement with Iran over its nuclear
program, the result could be, as one analyst writes, “reflected in [the two countries’] economic
relationship . . . and oil [exports] could be cut off.”80<br><br>
It is also common for Chinese analysts to encourage Beijing to link cooperation with
Washington on Iran opportunistically to U.S. weapon sales to Taiwan, in an attempt to extract
maximum leverage from China’s ties to Iran.81<br><br>
Even as they see many reasons to support Iran, some Chinese observers are concerned
that a stronger and more threatening Iran may spark a confrontation with the United States in
the Persian Gulf, which could prove disastrous for Chinese interests. Iran’s threats to close the
Strait of Hormuz have reinforced these anxieties, though Chinese commentators tend to blame
the United States for the potential closure of the strait.<br><br>

Other Chinese analysts manage to find a silver lining in this dark cloud, arguing that
a confrontation between Iran and the United States might not be an entirely bad thing for
China, because the end result of such a conflict would be an America so distracted, bogged
down, exhausted, and/or bankrupted that it would be incapable of focusing on containing the
growth of Chinese power in Asia, thus paving the way for China’s eventual arrival as a true
superpower. Such analysts can draw inspiration from prominent Chinese foreign policy analyst
Wang Jisi, dean of the Peking University School of International Studies, who has argued
that the U.S. war with Iraq benefited China because “It is beneficial for our external environment
to have the United States militarily and diplomatically deeply sunk in the Mideast to the
extent that it can hardly extricate itself.”82 Similarly, Renmin University professor Shi Yinhong
has recently argued that “Washington’s deeper involvement in the Middle East is favorable to
Beijing, reducing Washington’s ability to place focused attention and pressure on China.”83
Indeed, a U.S. conflict with Iran could place substantial limitations on the Obama administration’s
declared “pivot” back to the Asia-Pacific. At the same time, a U.S.-Iranian conflict
in which China was seen to have tacitly backed Iran up to the brink of war and then backed
away from the regime at a critical moment could carry implications for China’s credibility with
other states that tend to lean heavily on Chinese assistance, such as North Korea and Pakistan.<br><br>
Some Chinese analysts appear to believe that the PRC’s growing ties with Iran could
serve as a hedge to prevent Iran from falling into the U.S. orbit in the future, especially if the
Islamic Republic is overthrown and replaced by a more pro-American government.84 China’s
goal appears to be a long-term, broad, and deep relationship with Iran that could survive even
a democratic transition in Tehran. Such a close partnership would take on even greater importance
for Beijing if Pakistan were to collapse into anarchy. While some Chinese observers
dismiss assertions that China is trying to build an all-weather relationship with Iran, it does
appear consonant with the long-term direction of China’s policies toward building support for
and acceptance of the country’s rise.85 China’s relationship with Iran aims at strengthening and
preserving the regime while tightening its linkages to China in numerous arenas so that Iran
views China as a friendly power.<br><br>
Chinese foreign policy analysts also encourage Chinese policymakers to realize that
“using the positive factors present in the US-Iran conflict to expand [our] international influence
is [China’s] wisest choice” and urge PRC firms to “strive to grab more opportunities to
invest in Iran; use investments to further trade; and use investments in exchange for oil.”86<br><br>
Other Chinese observers, even while noting that ties with Iran are not likely to rise to the level
of importance of those with the United States, Japan, Russia, or the European Union, nonetheless
argue that ties with Iran contribute materially to the growth of China’s overall influence
and strategic weight in international affairs and help to block a potential adversary, the United
States, from dominating the strategically important Middle East.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T14">12. Diverging Interests Limit Chinese-Iranian Cooperation</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Despite their energy cooperation, trade, and shared geopolitical interests, Iran and China have
potentially divergent interests on a number of issues, possibly limiting the scope of their future
cooperation. Although China and Iran may appear united on their opposition to U.S. “hegemony,”
their respective interests vis-à-vis the United States differ greatly. China relies on the
United States for economic growth, whereas Iran is almost completely cut off from the U.S.<br><br>
economy and faces increasingly harsh U.S.-organized international sanctions. As such, China’s
ability to express its dissatisfaction with the United States is limited by its desire to maintain
stable trade and investment relations with it. The Islamic Republic, on the other hand, poses a
serious challenge to U.S. interests in the Middle East and beyond: It has provided direct support
to insurgents fighting U.S. forces in Iraq and continues this policy in Afghanistan, though
on a smaller scale, and Iran’s pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability is perceived by the United
States as a direct threat to its national security interests.<br><br>
The PRC and the Islamic Republic are both the creations of violent anti-Western revolutions,
but China has also shed much of its revolutionary ideology on foreign policy issues.<br><br>
The Islamic Republic, in contrast, is still a revolutionary entity at heart, and opposition to the
United States is a pillar of its claim to legitimacy. Similarly, Iran’s support for terrorist movements
and insurgencies is viewed in China with some consternation, as it may set a dangerous
precedent for Chinese minority groups chafing under Beijing’s rule. Iran’s efforts in creating
a potential nuclear weapons capability also conflict with China’s official position opposing
nuclear proliferation, a point recently reiterated by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao.87 Still, some
Chinese analysts appear to believe that a nuclear Iran would have advantages for China insofar
as it would serve as a check on U.S. influence in the Middle East, and few express much
anxiety that a nuclear-armed Iran would carry direct, negative implications for China’s own
security.<br><br>
While the more risk-averse elements of the Chinese political and foreign policy elites
(those focused on the long-term accretion of national power) appear to view Iran’s overall
behavior as posing some risks to China’s objective of maintaining a peaceful regional environment
so as to facilitate continued economic development, Beijing appears unlikely to budge
from its default approach of calling for further negotiations.88 At the same time, China’s formal
opposition to Iran’s nuclear program, its calls on Tehran to “show flexibility and sincerity and
have earnest cooperation with the [International Atomic Energy Agency],”89 and its negative
reaction to Iran’s threats to close the Strait of Hormuz are all sources of discomfort to the Iranian
leadership.90<br><br>
Chinese-Iranian economic ties have also created some backlash and dissatisfaction with
the relationship among some Iranians. Increasing numbers of Iranians appear to perceive Iran’s
economic ties with China as largely consisting of China buying Iranian oil, gas, and raw materials
while flooding the Iranian market with low-priced and inferior Chinese manufactured goods at the expense of Iran’s industrial development.91 The Ahmadinejad government has had
to defend itself against accusations that it has allowed unrestricted imports that have damaged
several Iranian industries, including the agricultural sector.92 Iran has also taken measures to
block “cheap” Chinese imports.93<br><br>
Moreover, the Islamic Republic has traditionally restricted foreign ownership of its energy
resources, which limits China’s opportunities to acquire equity in Iranian oil. Additionally,
foreign investors have historically experienced frustration with Iran’s approach to international
contract-making and business dealings, which regularly involve continuous rounds of contract
negotiations and unimplemented business deals. Chinese investors are said to have found this
every bit as frustrating as their Western and Japanese counterparts.94<br><br>
Furthermore, it is not clear whether China has the necessary technology and know-how
to help Iran exploit its oil and natural gas resources to the fullest extent possible. Iran has been
frustrated with China’s pace in developing Iranian natural gas reserves; the Iranian government
has even warned the China National Petroleum Corporation that it may cancel its $5
billion contract to develop phase 11 of South Pars field if the Chinese firm does not accelerate
its pace of exploration.95<br><br>
The close Chinese-Iranian relationship could also be put at risk if Iran undergoes a major
political transformation. A more democratic and secular Iran may resent China’s support for
the repressive Islamic Republic. Much will depend on Iran’s future relationship with the United
States. Continued hostility between the two could enhance Chinese influence in Iran, whereas
normalization of U.S.-Iranian relations could translate into significantly less Chinese influence
in Iran and perhaps throughout the Middle East if American, European, and other East Asian
companies begin to compete with China for contracts in Iran once more. Furthermore, a more
open and democratic Chinese government, were one to come about in the future, may view a
close relationship with Iran as less attractive, allowing the mobilization of greater international
pressure on the Islamic Republic regarding the nuclear program.<br><br>
The Chinese-Iranian partnership may be stronger than Iran’s relationship with Russia,
but it is not a partnership based on special cultural, religious, or ideological affinity, and it is
therefore strongly affected by international and domestic Iranian and Chinese circumstances.
Changes in both nations, and their relations with the United States, can fundamentally change
the nature of the Chinese-Iranian relationship and provide a strong point of leverage for U.S.
policy.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T15">13. Conclusion and Policy Options</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Relations between Iran and China have broadened and deepened relatively consistently over
the past three decades, overcoming the obstacles posed by ideology, differing geostrategic interests,
and changing leadership priorities. One implication of this assessment is that, barring
major disruptive changes, such as a military confrontation between Iran and the United States,
relations between Beijing and Tehran are likely to continue to steadily grow closer or at least
remain stable.<br><br>
Opposition to U.S. “hegemony” and some shared antipathy toward the West over its
efforts to promote democracy and human rights unite Beijing and Tehran. Leading politicians
and state functionaries from both China and Iran believe that their countries have their own
unique histories and cultural values and a level of sophistication that gives them the right to
determine their own social system and development model, irrespective of foreign criticism.
Iran supports China’s stated right to govern its people as the Chinese Communist Party sees
fit, while China supports Iranian sovereignty, which often translates into its right to suppress
opposition groups.<br><br>
It is unlikely that the United States will be able to fundamentally reshape either Iran’s or
China’s interests. Washington’s leverage with Iran is fairly limited due to the lack of diplomatic
and political ties, and increased U.S. pressure on Iran has the potential to drive Tehran further
into Beijing’s arms.<br><br>
The United States has greater leverage over China and may have policy options that could
convince Beijing to at least reduce its cooperation with and commitment to Iran. These include
offering enhanced cooperation between China and the United States across a range of issues
of importance to China; applying diplomatic pressure on China while sanctioning Chinese
firms that invest in Iran; encouraging energy producers other than Iran to increase petroleum
exports to China, thereby altering Beijing’s relative dependence on Iran; and building a global
coalition of partners that would put pressure on China to not undermine efforts to sanction
Iran.<br><br>
The United States has attempted to improve relations with China; one reason for this has
been to weaken China’s relations with Iran. The United States has also attempted to frame
the Iranian nuclear program as an issue of mutual concern and argue that it is in China’s own
interest to cease cooperation with Iran so as to lend credibility and weight to the sanctions
regime.<br><br>
However, given China’s interests regarding Iran, any inducements meant to separate Beijing
from Tehran would have to be quite substantial. Possible options include dramatically
raising the level of cooperation in U.S.-China relations; demonstrating greater acceptance of
China’s role in world affairs and perceived national security interests, such as its position on the
South China Sea; cooperation with Beijing on cross-Strait issues; and providing continued or
greater access to U.S. high-technology exports.<br><br>
The United States has been open to improved relations and greater cooperation with
China for many years. For example, in early 2005, Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick
gave a major policy speech seeking to reframe the U.S.-China relationship in which he stated
that the United States welcomed China’s role as a “responsible stakeholder,” explicitly tying
U.S. assessments of the “seriousness of China’s commitment to nonproliferation” to its “actions on Iran’s nuclear program.”96 Additionally, some have proposed that the United States offer
Beijing the opportunity to form a “Group of 2” nations that would manage global challenges,
such as ensuring the health of the world economy and addressing the nuclear proliferation
challenges posed by North Korea and Iran.97<br><br>
Under the Obama administration, the United States has acknowledged China’s “core
interests” in the November 2009 Joint Statement issued during President Obama’s visit to
China, while eliciting a promise from Beijing that, together with the United States, it would
call on Iran to “engage constructively with the P5+1 [China, France, Germany, Russia, the
United Kingdom, and the United States] and to cooperate fully with the IAEA [International
Atomic Energy Agency] to facilitate a satisfactory outcome.”98 In September 2010, National
Security Advisor Tom Donilon and National Economic Council Director Larry Summers
delivered a similar message of U.S. openness to expanded cooperation if China would work
with the administration on such issues as currency revaluation, North Korea, and Iran.99
Indeed, acceptance of China’s greater role in world affairs, including management of the proliferation
question, was a key feature of the Obama administration’s initial policy outreach to
Beijing and formed the centerpiece of both the administration’s proposal for a Strategic and
Economic Dialogue and the 2009 Joint Statement.<br><br>
Unfortunately, efforts to reassure Beijing that Washington acknowledges its importance
and accepts it as a critical player in world affairs do not appear to have been sufficient to win its
cooperation on Iran and may indeed have backfired, as they were perceived by some Chinese
analysts as a plot to get Beijing to carry Washington’s water for it, while other Chinese observers
saw these as a sign of Washington’s weakness and need for China’s help, thus encouraging
Beijing to drive an even harder bargain.<br><br>
If merely welcoming China to play a greater role in international organizations and world
affairs and acknowledging China’s core interests is not enough, perhaps a more substantial
outreach on Taiwan might convince Beijing to reduce its cooperation with Iran. A number of
analysts and observers have suggested adopting such a policy in the past two years, suggesting
that Washington start “treating China as a friend”;100 that the U.S. build better relations with
China by supporting the “Finlandization” of Taiwan, through steps such as “significantly”
scaling back on arms sales to the island;101 and that American foreign policy should begin
“backing away from its commitment to Taiwan.”102<br><br>
Analyses arguing in favor of extending greater “trust” to China and advocating linking
Chinese cooperation on Iran to U.S. abandonment of Taiwan have not explained how U.S.
officials can simply “trust” Beijing when many of its actions appear to American observers to
be both threatening and contrary to U.S. interests and values. Likewise, advocates of “Finlandizing” or reducing U.S. defense assistance to Taiwan overlook the fact that the U.S. executive
branch is bound by the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-8) to support Taiwan.103 As
such, the United States policy could not legally “trade” Taiwan to China in exchange for cooperation
on Iran unless Congress were to repeal the act, a step it is unlikely to take.<br><br>
Another inducement for China to reduce cooperation with Iran might be to liberalize
U.S. trade restrictions on high-technology goods and defense articles. China would very much
like to gain access to sensitive military and industrial technologies, which could help further
its defense and economic modernization drive. However, the lifting of restrictions on sensitive
defense technology exports to the PRC could greatly benefit a country routinely identified by
U.S. analysts as the only possible “near-peer competitor” capable of one day matching U.S.
military power. Moreover, the executive branch would bump up against the congressionally
mandated restrictions on defense technology exports to China that were enacted after the
1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. At present, Congress does not appear willing to lift such
restrictions.<br><br>
If carrots are out, what about sticks? It seems reasonable to think that the United States
might consider the use of punitive measures against China if positive inducements, which
are mostly politically unpalatable, appear unlikely to succeed. This would include sanctions
against Chinese defense and energy firms conducting business with Iran.<br><br>
Because punitive measures against Chinese firms entail trade-offs for the broader U.S.-
Chinese relationship, any sanctions should be crafted in such a way as to preserve the possibility
of inducing cooperation rather than encouraging confrontation. As Erica Downs and Suzanne
Maloney have noted, the United States could “fall into an unintended trade war with China
or see relations between the two countries deteriorate” in the absence of a carefully crafted
strategy for how to deal with China on the Iran issue.104 If not well calibrated, China may take
actions in response to any U.S. sanctions by reducing its cooperation on North Korea, cutting
off military-military ties again, or attempting to punish U.S. firms operating in China.<br><br>
To mitigate these risks, the United States is sanctioning Chinese firms in a piecemeal
fashion rather than moving quickly to punish a large number of firms at the same time. In
2010, China and the United States agreed that Washington would not sanction Chinese energy
development firms for their previous investments if they agreed to make no further investments.
105 The United States has also threatened to sanction Chinese banks over their payments
to insurance firms dealing with Iranian shipping.106<br><br>
Recently, the United States announced it would apply sanctions to Chinese state energy
trading firm Zhuhai Zhenrong over that company’s sale of refined petroleum products into the Iranian market. This move has not yet resulted in the Chinese government doing more
than expressing its “strong dissatisfaction and adamant opposition” to the “unreasonable” U.S.
sanctions, but it could contribute to worsening bilateral relations between Washington and
Beijing.107<br><br>
The United States has also encouraged friendly oil-producing countries, such as Saudi
Arabia, to export more oil to China in an effort to reduce the PRC’s dependence on Iranian
oil.108 Initially, Chinese oil imports appeared to shift somewhat from mid-2009 onward as the
United States urged Saudi Arabia to export more oil to China in order to wean it off of Iranian
oil (see Table 13.1). However, according to media reports citing official Chinese statistics, PRC
imports of Iranian crude oil rose more than 31 percent in 2011, to 560,000 barrels per day,
suggesting that Beijing’s shift away from Iranian oil in 2010 was only temporary and was more
than made up for by expanded sales in 2011.109 China’s purchases of Iranian oil under direct
contract did decrease in January 2012, but it remains to be seen if this is a temporary occurrence
rather than a long-term trend.110 Still, initial signs in 2012 appear to be that Beijing is
cutting back on its purchases of Iranian crude and turning to other sources, even as its overall
crude imports soar.111 <br><br>

In general, China’s imports of Iranian crude have grown despite the fact that international
sanctions against Iran have made payments by China more difficult, forcing the two
countries to find ways around this through barter trade.112 China’s continued economic expansion,
combined with the high intensity of Chinese growth, is helping to fuel its demand for
overseas energy.<br><br>
In all likelihood, the failure of U.S. efforts to reshape China’s approach to Iran reflects the
fact that Beijing’s relationship with the Islamic Republic is multifaceted and has moved beyond
energy ties. As John Garver has argued, changing China’s “long standing policy [approach
on relations with Iran] is probably very difficult.”113 Indeed, a change in China’s policy may
require something as dramatic as a change of regime in Beijing or a major upsurge in the level
of confrontation between Washington and Tehran, such that it becomes too costly for Beijing
to pursue strong ties with Iran.<br><br>
In the absence of such changes, China is likely to continue to oppose sanctions against
Iran while supporting engagement and dialogue, which have thus far failed to resolve the
nuclear impasse. In addition, China will most likely seek to delay and/or dilute any future
sanctions against Iran by the United Nations as much as possible. A particular emphasis on
a “diplomatic solution” may indicate the Chinese government’s willingness to let the nuclear
issue simmer, as long as it does not lead to full-scale conflict between Iran and the United
States (and perhaps Israel).<br><br>
In sum, the U.S. ability to fundamentally reshape China’s relationship with Iran through
positive or negative inducements is fairly limited, though Washington does have some levers.
China’s perception that it is moving toward an intensifying rivalry with the United States,
together with its deep economic involvement with Iran, give Beijing reason to maintain its
cooperative relationship with the Islamic Republic and possibly even broaden and/or deepen
relations in the future.<br><br>
At the same time, if Chinese leaders come to perceive the risks of conflict between the
United States and Iran as too great, they may begin to dial back China’s exposure to Iran so
as to minimize the risks to Chinese investments. Alternatively, if U.S.-Chinese tensions grow,
cooperation on Iran, including a freeze on new investment or a drawdown in oil imports,
could be one way that Beijing might seek to improve relations with the United States at Iran’s
expense. While Beijing will not formally or fully support strong international sanctions on
Iran, it could begin to downplay its relations in ways that are less visible and pose less risk to
long-term Chinese-Iranian relations but nonetheless carry strategic implications.114<br><br>
Finally, potential social and political changes in Iran or China could lead one or both
actors to dramatically reevaluate the bilateral relationship. As noted previously, the interests
of Iran and China do not always coincide. In addition, neither country is destined to remain
an authoritarian state forever. Democratic forces in either country could precipitate the emergence
of a more democratic and secular Iran that may not seek nuclear weapons or a China
less hostile to U.S. interests because it is not governed by a one-party communist dictatorship.<br><br>
Of course, such changes may come slowly and are hardly guaranteed. In the meantime, the
United States should continue to deploy a set of national and international strategies to try to prevent an Iranian nuclear weapons capability and use a combination of bilateral and multilateral
diplomatic pressure and incentives to convince China to reduce ties to Iran.<br><br>

为什么是伊朗呢？其实是起于两部电影几本书。<br><br>

 

 先是2012年看了一部伊朗电影《一次别离》（英文译名是Aseparation）。这是一本客观真实得好像纪录片的文艺片。用白描的手法（白描是中国人的说法，后来到了伊朗，我觉得伊朗人大概会说成“用细密画的手法”）讲述了普通伊朗人的生活现状，信仰和感情。看完后我的感想是：<br><br>

1.     Wow，能拍出这种电影的人是很有文化的，佩服佩服！<br><br>

2.     伊朗人跟我从媒体中得到的印象很不一样啊！他们应该绝大多数并不是恐怖分子，也不是宗教狂热分子。<br><br>

3.     伊朗人和中国人的精神世界原来有很多相似相通的地方啊！<br><br>

 

 这三个感叹号提起了我对伊朗的兴趣。然而忙工作忙家庭，日子忽忽一下就又过了一年，今年看了Argo（中文译名《逃离德黑兰》），看完后的感想是：<br><br>

1.     小本又导又演，有两把刷子，好典型的好莱坞风格啊！<br><br>

2.     切--伊朗人不太可能那么粗鲁愚笨的吧？！<br><br>

 

 脑子里两个感叹号还没消化，又看到一则新闻，说伊朗请了个法国女律师代表伊朗政府将好莱坞电影制片商告上国际法庭，抗议他们诋毁伊朗人的形象。律师说，伊朗“不要求禁播《逃离德黑兰》，只是希望制片方发表声明承认影片中描述的情况与现实不符”。我觉得这个诉求既有骨气，又有分寸，更觉得这个民族应该是很有文化的，他们很有可能是被西方媒体给说坏了。可是西方世界为什么要说坏它呢？伊朗人到底是怎样的人呢？他们经历过又正在经历着什么呢？<br><br>

 

 在好奇心的驱使下，我找来一些书了解伊朗的古文明，了解70年代末的那场伊斯兰革命，还读了2本伊朗人写的小说（一共就找到2本）。我觉得自己知道了一些，但更多的问题从阅读中冒出来，于是有个强烈的声音从心里响起：“我要去伊朗自己看一看！”<br><br>

 

 做过调查之后，我决定这次跟团出行。一来是在携程上查到去伊朗的一个11天的行程，包括了基本上所有我计划要去的地方。根据行程的安排，我估计着每个地方的时间也较充足，应该不至于走马观花。二来跟团的话会有一个当地伊朗人做导游讲解，对伊朗这样一个以历史人文，风土人情为主的国家来说，当地人的讲解其实是很重要的，不然很多时候，一个人在那里东看西看也看不出个门道。三呢，我这次旅程是怀着对伊朗人浓厚的兴趣和好奇，如果可以近距离和伊朗人接触交谈就更好了。四呢，跟团意味着做个甩手掌柜，把所有琐事烦务都抛开，专心体验就好。五呢，其实出行前，我也不太清楚到底安不安全，但我知道这个国家目前对女性还是有诸多限制，所以跟团安全性会高一些，对独自旅行的女性也会更便利。事实比我的预想还要好，原来我们这个团只有10个人，来自5个地方和6个旅行社（只有我一个人是携程的），由马汉假期领队出发。我的团友，室友虽然都素不相识，但都是热爱旅行的人，很有共同语言，相处得非常愉快。这一行有好些比预想还要好的东西，让我一一道来。<br><br>


一提到伊朗，人们自然会想起沙漠、石油、中东、西亚，还有核能危机……其实，伊朗是个非常美丽的国家，早在5000年前，伊朗就创建了灿烂的古代文明。一个高原山地国家，南濒波斯湾和阿曼湾，北接里海，一望无垠的沙漠王国中，点缀着片片绿洲……<br><br>
这里曾是古波斯帝国首都所在地，曾盛极一时、成为世界上第一个地跨亚、非、欧三大洲的帝国，曾为世界各民族的融合、人类文明的发展做出了重大贡献；现在更是世界十大古代遗迹最丰富的国家之一，被联合国认为是人类文明的一大摇篮。这个昔日的帝国，如今由于西方的抵制却变得神秘兮兮了。<br><br>
事实上，它还有诗酒风流的哈菲兹故乡设拉子，轻快优雅的“伊斯法罕半天下”，严肃凝重的圣城马什哈德，或是往返于伊斯兰共和国的两大权力中心--德黑兰与库姆。此外，这里有着让你意外的热情人民以及让你感叹不已的精美清真寺。<br><br>


一周的时间转便伊朗的主要城市，看波斯遗迹，访清真寺，了解宗教、了解历史。<br><br>

早上前往琼班尖塔，又称“摇摇塔”，它一位公元7至8世纪，颇具神秘色彩的伊斯兰圣人的陵墓。它的两座小尖塔十分神奇，如果钻进其中一个尖塔内使劲摇晃，塔身便会摇摆，而与它相距数米之外的另一座尖塔，也会同时跟着晃动--这就是伊斯法罕被称为“建在陵墓之上的摇摇塔”了。<br><br>

然后前往亚美尼亚教堂，也是这里少见的基督教堂，教堂内的墙壁上画满了壁画，但禁止拍照。然后参观纪念亚美尼亚人被土耳其人屠杀的纪念碑。<br><br>

中午吃了饭到伊斯法罕的聚礼清真寺，聚礼清真寺也可以叫做星期五清真寺；因为穆斯林都是在星期五进行集体礼拜，进行这样活动的清真寺就叫做聚礼清真寺，是每个穆斯林城市必备的宗教设施。<br><br>

<a href= "pic08.html">伊朗旅游地图</a><br><br>

经典线路<br><br>
 　　设拉子(hiraz)→亚兹德(azd)→伊斯法罕(Esfahan)→ 德黑兰(Tehran)<br><br>

设拉子："玫瑰和夜莺之城"及"诗人的故乡"<br><br>

 
　　设拉子不但是诗人的故乡，还是一座充满诗情画意的城市。在设拉子的大街小巷漫步，往往不经意间就会走入一座清新、秀丽的街心公园。绿草芊绵，鲜花盛开，喷泉涌动，石径通幽，老人、小孩、情侣在其中休憩游玩，成为一景。路人步伐悠闲，与你擦肩而过时总是友好地点头、微笑。<br><br>

亚兹德："不死的城市"<br><br>
 
 
　　从设拉子一路向北，整个世界就只剩下两种颜色，天空的蓝和戈壁的黄。在戈壁的深处，有一座叫做亚兹德(Yazd)古老城市，这里没有宏伟的建筑，没有耀眼的装饰也没有辉煌的历史，但他保存完好的古城和独特的氛围却吸引了无数游人流连忘返。<br><br>
 　　从广袤的戈壁进入亚兹德，并没有出现想象中的绿洲也没有任何现代化的影子，这里地处两片沙漠交界处的边缘地带，自古以来就不算是个兵家必争之地，而是商旅们来往歇脚和补给的地方，并渐渐发展成了繁荣的商埠，马可波罗先生也曾背包至此并留下赞美之词。千年以来亚兹德没有经历过大的战乱和自然灾害，不单是古老的建筑和民居得以完好的保存下来，更弥漫着独特的历史氛围和文化气息，难怪有人说亚兹德是地球上最古老的城市，因为他至今仍活着，人们住在古老的土屋里继续经营着丝绸和地毯生意，神秘的拜火教圣火也从未熄灭过。<br><br>

伊斯法罕："半个世界"<br><br>



 
　　如果说伊斯法罕是半个世界，那Imam广场就是半个伊斯法罕。Imam广场四周的建筑和拱门式的围墙很是耐看，南面的Imam清真寺华丽大气，东面的Sheikh Lotfollah清真寺造型独特，没有塔楼没有广场，只有一个漂亮的穹顶，据说这是为Abbas国王的岳父所建。广场西面的Ali Qapu宫殿是当年Abbas国王的行宫，广场北面是Bozorg大巴扎。<br><br>
 　　如果说Imam广场代表了半个伊斯法罕，那另一半就非桥莫属了。在蜿蜒的Zayande河上建有新旧11座桥，其中5座有着数百年历史却依然沿用至今。Zayande河水源于高山止于沙漠，为了合理控制水流，古老的拱桥同时也起到水坝的作用，这其中最著名也是最漂亮当属33孔桥，这是当年由Abbas国王的大将军Allahverdi所建，两层的拱墙结构美轮美奂。每当清晨或傍晚时分，这里总是人山人海，不单是游客，当地人也喜欢聚集于此聊天会友创作发呆，尤其是站在岸边可以欣赏每个桥拱里的人物百态和众生相。顺着河岸往东，还有一座造型类似但更为精致的古桥Khaju，沿河两岸都是美丽的公园。<br><br>

德黑兰：现代明珠<br><br>





 
　　坐上由中国援建的地铁漫游这座城市，第一站来到国家博物馆，伊朗国家博物馆是世界上最重要的博物馆之一，建筑面积约为1.8万平方米，文物古迹多达30万件，包括史前文物、前伊斯兰时期文物和伊斯兰时期文物等等。是古老的伊朗文明的缩影。<br><br>
 　　这座城市的中点是Imam Khomeini广场。广场以南有一座金碧辉煌的Golestan宫殿，这座宫殿的历史比德黑兰成为都城的时间还长，从兴建至今已有500年，历经了各代王朝的扩建和改造，并在18世纪正式成为了Qajar王朝的皇宫。上世纪30年代，Palhavi王朝的国王Reza Shah认为前朝的建筑不够现代，于是一大批老建筑被无情的拆毁并推陈出新，现在的Golestan Palace就像一座历史公园，每一栋小楼每一尊雕塑甚至是每一面彩墙都有自己的故事。可惜得很，很多地方要不不允许拍照，要不就光顾着看忘记拍了。外墙倒是有一些萨法维时期的壁画挺有趣的。
 　　步行大约10多分钟，来到了德黑兰大巴扎。大巴扎里，从中国生产的便宜货到伊朗本土出产的价值昂贵的地毯，什么都有得卖。地铁1号线通过大巴扎，所以人来人往，好不热闹。<br><br>
 　　德黑兰的最后一站是地标性建筑--AzadiTower(自由塔)，自由塔建于1971年，为纪念波斯帝国2500周年而建。这座造型奇特的巨大建筑是Pahlavi王朝为庆祝波斯帝国成立2500年而建，并且有着伊朗之门以及国王之塔的意思，可是1979年革命之后，国王之塔被改名成了现在的自由之塔，皇气褪尽后反倒成了革命的象征。<br><br>

提醒<br><br>
 　　签证：申请时需提供以下资料：有效期超过六个月以上有效护照、照片(4张2寸彩照、白底色)、旅游者本人填写的签证申请表、申请人单位在职证明信(原件、单位抬头纸打印、中英文对照)、身份证复印件以及往返机票和在伊旅馆登记证明等。由于申请办理伊朗签证需在伊朗申请反签号，后用反签号在中国申请伊朗签证，因此办理时间需25天左右。签证3个月有效，15天停留，约40欧元。<br><br>
 　　汇率：1欧元=11，000IRR，1Doman(俗称1刀)=10IRR。在伊朗境内不法使用信用卡等国际支付手段，建议先兑换好现金。<br><br>
 　　门票：伊朗境内，普遍门票都是5000IRR，似乎都统一了，票都是波斯波利斯的封面。<br><br>
 　　交通状况：德黑兰市现有机动车300多万辆，交通很拥挤，交通事故也很常见。在德黑兰外出可乘坐公交车、地铁和出租车。<br><br>
 　　气候：伊朗东部和内地属大陆性亚热带草原和沙漠气候，寒暑变化剧烈，夏季干燥炎热，冬季寒冷多风。8月里伊朗温度昼夜差异较大，约24℃~40℃。<br><br>
 　　衣着：由于伊朗宗教国家的特性，伊朗要求在伊朗领土上的所有女性(学前儿童除外)外出时须带头巾和穿着长外衣，否则可能会受到处罚。男性不可穿着短裤外出。<br><br>
 　　住宿：伊斯法罕住宿选择比较多，有老客栈改建而成的5星级 Ali Qapu hotel，也有3美元/天床的小客栈。热闹的Chahar Bagn-e Pain街上的 Amir Kabir Hotel，老板多年接待外国游客，英文流利。<br><br>
 　　饮食：伊朗人主食为馕和米饭，流行吃法是将喜欢的配菜和酱料厚厚塞在馕中。伊朗犹太教徒认为猪肉等是不洁之物，属禁用之列，尤其忌带血食物。伊朗不同的地区，人们往往根据当地现存的自然环境和条件来烹煮各种富有地方色彩的食品，这些食物被视为民族传统食品，其中最著名的有：契罗喀保布(伴有烤羊串或烤牛肉串、鸡肉串的焖饭)；奥布古事特(将羊肉、豆子、香料和土豆等放在水中一起焖煨，近似我国西安的羊肉泡馍)等。伊朗的鱼籽酱是用里海的鲟鱼制成，在世界上享有盛誉，滋补性很强，波斯湾的虾类由于质量上乘，故被用来烹煮各种食物。<br><br>
 　　购物：藏红花是伊朗特产，还有开心果、波斯地毯及手工艺品等。中藏红花的影子随处可见。每克藏红花按品质售价为5至8元人民币，游客出境时最多可携带200克。<br><br>



伊朗的政府机关及法院之类的建筑是不允许拍照的！德黑兰的地铁共四条线，是由中国承建的。但任何人都不能例外。伊朗英语普及率的问题，85%的伊朗人不会英文，包括年轻人。伊朗的主要城市都有自己的大巴扎，在这里最能够体验当地人的生活。这里是最接地气的地方，也能够淘到许多具有当地特色的特产。如德黑兰的市场大巴扎（Tehran Bazaar）。<br><br>

开斋节<br><br>
时间：伊斯兰教历10月1日<br><br>

按伊斯兰教法规定，伊斯兰教历每年9月为斋戒月。凡成年健康的穆斯林都应全月封斋，即每日从拂晓前至日落，禁止饮食和房事等。封斋第29日傍晚如见新月，次日即为开斋节；如不见，则再封一日，共为30日，第二日为开斋节，庆祝一个月的斋功圆满完成。<br><br>

	<b><a name="T17">伊朗简介</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
伊朗伊斯兰共和国（The Islamic Republic of Iran），1935年以前称为波斯，位于亚洲西南部，属中东国家，伊朗中北部紧靠里海、南靠波斯湾和阿拉伯海。伊朗东邻巴基斯坦和阿富汗，东北部与土库曼斯坦接壤，西北与阿塞拜疆和亚美尼亚为邻，西界土耳其和伊拉克。伊朗石油资源丰富，石油出口是经济命脉，石油生产能力和石油出口量分别位于世界第四位和第二位。伊朗也是石油输出国组织成员。2005年末，中国与伊朗签署了一项价值1000亿美元的石油合作协议，成为该国重要的石油贸易伙伴。<br><br>
<a href= "pic08.html">伊朗旅游地图</a><br><br>
伊朗是一个多民族的穆斯林国家，其中波斯人占66%，阿塞拜疆人占25%，库尔德人占5%，官方语言为波斯语，伊斯兰教（什叶派）为国教，98．8%的居民信奉伊斯兰教，其中91%为什叶派，7．8%为逊尼派。德黑兰Teheran位于横亘伊朗北部厄尔布斯山的南麓，有人口1100万。
<br><br>
埃兰王国<br><br>
（公元前3千纪上半期至公元前639年）：埃兰人居住在伊朗高原西南部卡伦河流域，他们是伊朗高原的土著人。公元前第3千纪上半期，埃兰人建立了国家。公元前1176年，埃兰国攻陷巴比伦。公元前639年，埃兰国被亚述人所灭。<br><br>
米底王国<br><br>
（公元前639年至公元前550年）：公元前2千纪，中亚的印欧人种雅利安人的一支南迁至伊朗高原，并逐渐与土著居民融合、同化，形成了伊朗人的主体。公元前7世纪中叶，米底部落击败周围其它部落，建立了伊朗历史上第一个统一的雅利安人国家。公元前6世纪初，米底部落征服伊朗西南部的波斯部落，并灭亚述帝国，其疆域扩至现土耳其安纳托利亚东部、现伊朗西部、东部和西南部。公元前550年，米底国被波斯帝国居鲁士大帝所灭。<br><br>
波斯帝国<br><br>
（公元前550年至公元前330年）<br><br>
波斯部落最初居住在伊朗高原西南部，后经过数十年扩充疆土，公元前550年，居鲁士大帝推翻米底部落的统治，建立了波斯帝国。在国王大流士一世（公元前522年至公元前486年）统治时期，波斯帝国达到鼎盛时期，其疆土东起印度河流域和中亚内陆地区直至帕米尔高原的西部，西至巴尔干半岛，北起亚美尼亚，南至埃塞俄比亚。包括70个民族，5000万人，近700万平方公里土地，成为世界上第一个地跨亚、非、欧三大洲的帝国。波斯帝国在公元前492年希（腊）波（斯）战争后逐渐由鼎盛走向衰落。公元前334年，马其顿国王亚历山大大帝东侵，征服波斯全境。<br><br>
条枝王国<br><br>
（公元前330年至公元前247年）<br><br>
亚历山大大帝在波斯积极推行“希腊化”的殖民统治。公元前323年，亚历山大大帝死后，他所建的帝国分裂，其部将塞琉古（马其顿人）夺得帝国东部广大地区，并于公元前312年称王，以叙利亚为中心建立塞琉西王国，中国古称条枝。塞琉西王国全盛时，疆域包括小亚细亚、叙利亚、两河流域、波斯和中亚的部分地区。<br><br>
安息王朝<br><br>
（公元前247年至公元224年）<br><br>
公元前247年，波斯的帕尔尼部族打败塞琉西王国军队，在波斯土地上建立了阿萨希斯王朝。中国史称安息王朝，西方史学家称之为帕提亚王朝。安息王朝由于同罗马的长期战争和朝廷的内讧，从公元1世纪以后逐渐衰落。<br><br>
萨珊王朝<br><br>
（224年至651年）<br><br>
公元224年，安息王朝被萨珊王朝推翻。萨珊王朝建立后又向东扩张至印度河中上游，曾一度成为古代伊朗最辉煌的时期。随着同罗马帝国的战争、封建割据、人民起义、中亚游牧部落及阿拉伯人入侵而逐渐衰落。<br><br>
阿拉伯时期<br><br>
（651年至874年）<br><br>
公元651年，阿拉伯帝国第三任哈里发奥斯曼・依本・阿凡推翻萨珊王朝，占领波斯全境。伊斯兰教取代祆教（拜火教），成为伊朗居民的主要信仰。伊朗被征服后，成为阿拉伯帝国的一个行省。自公元661年至11世纪初，阿拉伯帝国先后经历了倭玛亚王朝和阿拔斯王朝，伊朗成为这两个王朝的一部分。从9世纪起，阿拔斯王朝日渐衰落，在伊朗境内及其邻近地区，相继出现一些独立或半独立的地方封建王朝，与其分庭抗礼。<br><br>
波斯复兴--萨曼王朝<br><br>
（874年-999年）<br><br>
公元874年，古波斯萨曼家族的成员伊斯玛仪・本・艾哈迈德（892～907在位）以布哈拉为首府，正式称“埃米尔”，创立了萨曼王朝，名义上仍承认阿拔斯王朝哈里发的宗主权，但实际仅向哈里发奉献贡物，报告军务。他效法古波斯与哈里发宫廷建立了统一的行政和军事制度，确立了王朝与辖地的隶属关系。萨曼家族原本信奉拜火教，此时已经皈依了伊斯兰教。萨曼王朝的几代君主励精图治，一度把疆域扩张到费尔干纳以及更远的地方。由于萨曼王朝强大的影响力，中亚许多突厥游牧部落纷纷进入波斯帝国内定居生活，此外伊斯兰教在中亚广泛流行，从而开启了中亚突厥人伊斯兰化的进程。萨曼王朝疆域最大时包括中亚、波斯大部分、阿富汗等地。<br><br>
波斯帝国的突厥王朝<br><br>
（999年-13世纪初）<br><br>
公元962年，萨曼王朝的一名突厥近卫军将领在国内建立了伽色尼王朝，公元999年，伽色尼王朝联合中亚另一个突厥帝国--喀喇汗王朝灭了萨曼王朝。伽色尼王朝取而代之，继承了萨曼王朝的大部分领土。11世纪中期，另外一个突厥部落--塞尔柱突厥人由中亚兴起，推翻了伽色尼王朝统治，并先后征服巴格达、叙利亚、拜占庭帝国，建立起一个东起中亚、西至博斯普鲁斯海峡，包括伊朗在内的塞尔柱帝国，但帝国不久即告分裂。12世纪末，花剌子模沙王朝夺取伊朗东北部，13世纪初占领伊朗全境。它统治的疆域还包括伊拉克、阿富汗等地区。<br><br>
蒙古入侵--伊儿汗国
（1258年-14世纪中叶）<br><br>
成吉思汗于1219年率军西侵，先后征服了花剌子模、中亚细亚、亚美尼亚、阿塞拜疆等地，杀死花剌子模国王，掠夺大量财物后撤回蒙古本土。1229年成吉思汗的儿子窝阔台二次讨伐花剌子模，杀死国王后返朝。1260年，成吉思汗之孙旭烈兀再次率兵占据伊朗并建立以伊朗为中心的伊儿汗王朝。此后，蒙古人逐渐接受了伊斯兰教，并任用伊朗人为行政官吏。<br><br>
帖木儿帝国<br><br>
（1380年至1405年）<br><br>
随着伊儿汗国的逐渐衰落，当时的伊朗又陷入地方封建王朝割据之中。西察合台汗国（今乌兹别克境内）的突厥国王帖木儿（1336年至1405年在位）在夺取中亚地区后于1380年至1393年征服伊朗全境，继而侵占美索不达米亚，并入侵印度。1405年帖木儿死后，他的帝国迅速瓦解，统治范围只限于中亚河中地区和伊朗东部，但15世纪帖木儿王朝的文化艺术相当繁荣。<br><br>
黑羊王朝与白羊王朝<br><br>
（1467-1502年）<br><br>
随着帖木儿王朝在伊朗统治的衰落，两个由突厥土库曼人建立的王朝开始强大，他们分别是黑羊王朝与白羊王朝，两个王朝发源于土耳其东部、阿塞拜疆以及伊朗西北部地区。其中黑羊王朝在30、40年代实力较强，但随后被更为强大的白羊王朝击败，白羊王朝在乌宗.哈桑的带领下，一度统一了伊朗的大部分地区。<br><br>
萨法维王朝<br><br>
（1502年至1722年）<br><br>
白羊王朝时期，一个名为萨菲社团的什叶派社团在伊朗西北十分活跃，这个社团的成员多为突厥土库曼人与阿塞拜疆人。他们的首领有着古波斯贵胄的头衔，趁白羊王朝动乱之际于1502年推翻其统治，建立了萨法维王朝。此后国力逐步强大，极盛时版图包括阿富汗的坎大哈、赫拉特。萨法维王朝与奥斯曼帝国曾长期进行战争。萨法维王朝是伊朗历史上第一个以什叶派伊斯兰教为国教的朝代，对什叶派在伊朗的发挥壮大起了重要作用。17世纪末，萨法维王朝日渐衰落。1722年，阿富汗的吉尔扎部落在马赫穆德的领导下，攻占萨法维王朝国都伊斯法罕，并自立为伊朗国王。<br><br>
赞德王朝与阿夫沙尔王朝<br><br>
（1736年至1796年）<br><br>
1736年，来自伊朗呼罗珊地区的部落首领纳迪尔率军把阿富汗人逐出伊朗，并以马什哈德为中心建立阿夫沙尔王朝。经过数年战争，阿夫沙尔王朝版图一度东至阿富汗和印度北部，西至巴格达，北接里海，南濒波斯湾。1747年，纳迪尔国王死后，其儿孙为争夺王位而爆发内战，各路诸侯纷纷称王，其中凯历姆汗（1749年至1779年在位）以设拉子为首都建立了赞德王朝。经过多年战争，赞德王朝占据了除霍拉桑及以东地区以外的阿夫沙尔王朝的土地。1779年凯历姆汗死后，赞德王朝分裂。1792年和1796年，赞德王朝和阿夫沙尔王朝先后被恺加王朝所灭。<br><br>
恺加王朝<br><br>
（1779年至1921年）<br><br>
恺加王朝建于1779年，首次定都德黑兰。恺加王朝初期，西方列强加紧在伊朗的争夺。1801年俄国兼并格鲁吉亚；英国同伊朗三次战争导致伊朗割地赔款及承认阿富汗独立。此后法国、奥地利、美国等相继强迫伊朗订立了不平等条约。19世纪下半叶，英、俄攫取了在伊采矿、筑路、设立银行、训练军队等特权。1907年，英、俄两国相互勾结划分了在伊的势力范围：北部属俄国，南部属英国，中部为缓冲区。 之后，法国、奥地利、美国等相继强迫伊朗签订不平等条约。伊朗虽然名义上仍是"独立"国家，但实际上处于半封建、半殖民地的地位。“往昔波斯帝国的辉煌与今日的耻辱形成鲜明对照，伊朗在追求复兴强国的路上必然产生强烈的民族主义，而强烈的民族主义又很容易导致极端主义和盲目的排外思潮。”[3]<br><br>
从19世纪下半叶至20世纪初，随着欧洲列强的侵入，伊朗逐渐沦为半殖民地国家，社会经济衰落，封建统治专横残暴，多次发生人民起义。1921年2月，军官礼萨汗・巴列维发动政变，夺取政权，建立巴列维王朝。<br><br>
巴列维王朝<br><br>
礼萨汗・巴列维（1925年至1941年在位）对内采取了一些发展社会经济的措施，但同时实行个人独裁。1921年，伊与苏联签订协议，废除了沙俄与伊签订的不平等条约。1927年，伊宣布废除所有与外国签订的不平等条约及外国在伊的领事裁判权，并实行关税自主。<br><br>
第二次世界大战前，伊朗与纳粹德国关系较密切。1941年6月德国入侵苏联后，英国和苏联出兵伊朗。礼萨汗・巴列维被迫退位，其子穆罕默德・礼萨・巴列维继位（1941年至1979年在位）。1942年1月，英国、苏联和伊朗订立同盟条约。1943年9月，伊朗对德宣战。<br><br>
二战结束后，伊与英、美关系趋于密切，英、美对伊在政治、军事上给予大量支持和帮助，同时也趁机控制了伊的经济命脉。60年代初，巴列维为巩固其统治，缓和国内各阶层间日益尖锐的矛盾，提出以土改、工人入股分红、出售工厂股票、在农村开展卫生和扫盲运动等为主要内容的“社会改革计划”。这一以世俗化和现代化为核心的改革计划又称“白色革命”。但由于脱离国情、触及宗教人士利益，造成经济严重失调，贫富悬殊加剧，各种社会、宗教矛盾激化，各地动乱不断升级。1979年1月，国王被迫出走海外。2月1日，因领导反国王运动而流亡国外的宗教领袖霍梅尼返回伊朗。2月11日，忠于国王的军队倒戈，巴列维王朝覆灭。霍梅尼宣布成立伊朗伊斯兰共和国。<br><br>

<a href= "pic07.html">穆斯林人口统计</a><br><br>	
公元610年由阿拉伯人穆罕默德创建了伊斯兰教。公元632年，穆罕默德去世后，他的信徒们在继承权问题上发生了激烈的争执。<br><br>

　　一派主张继承人应由穆斯林公社根据资历、威望选举产生。因而认为穆罕默德的门徒、由穆斯林公社推选的哈里法（政教合一的领袖，共四人）是合法继承人。拥护这个主张的穆斯林即后来的“逊尼派”。该派把穆罕默德早期追随者的言论和事迹编成一本书--《圣训经》，称为《逊奈》。“逊尼派”的名称即由此而来。目前，全世界伊斯兰教穆斯林90％属于这一派。他们广泛分布在西亚、北非的大多数阿拉伯国家。并自称“正统派”。<br><br>

　　另一部分人，主张世袭原则，认为穆罕默德的堂弟、女婿阿里做为合法继承人符合世袭原则。支持这一主张的穆斯林后来被称为什叶派。全世界10％的穆斯林属这一派。其中近一半在伊朗。什叶派否认逊尼派所拥戴的哈里法作为宗教领袖的合法性，称宗教领袖的最高领袖为伊玛姆，阿里为第一任伊玛目。此后，直到第12代伊玛目，均是阿里的嫡传子孙。<br><br>

　　伊斯兰教是公元7世纪初由穆罕默德在阿拉伯半岛创立的。伊斯兰在阿拉伯语中意为顺服，指顺服真主安拉的旨意。伊斯兰教内教派很多，有报道说多达70多个，但主要是两大教派：逊尼派和什叶派。<br><br>

　　公元632年，穆罕默德去世，当时他没有留下遗嘱安排谁为哈里发，即继承人，也没有谈到以什么形式推选哈里发。按照阿拉伯人的传统，领袖是从部落上层有威望的人中推选的。然而穆罕默德所建的公社包括了许多部落，哪个部落有优先权呢？后经协商，先后推选阿布 伯克尔、欧麦尔、奥斯曼为前3任哈里发。<br><br>

　　逊尼派全称为“逊奈与大众派”，阿拉伯语原意为“遵循传统者”。逊尼派是伊斯兰教中教徒最多的一个教派，占全世界穆斯林的90％左右。此教派的教徒主要分布在阿拉伯国家以及土耳其、印度、马来西亚等国。逊尼派虽然将其他不同信仰视为异端，却同时提倡求大同存小异，融合不同见解，努力调合真主的无限权威和人的责任这两个观念。<br><br>

　　什叶派是伊斯兰教中仅次于逊尼派的第二大教派。“什叶”在阿拉伯语中意为“追随者”或者“派别”、“同党”。该派认为只有出身于哈希姆家族（即圣族）的阿里及其直系后裔才是穆罕默德的合法继承人，否认阿布 伯克尔、欧麦尔、奥斯曼前3任哈里发的合法性。目前该派主要分布在伊朗、伊拉克、印度、巴基斯坦、也门、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、阿富汗、土耳其、巴林等国。什叶派的主要支派是十二伊玛目派、伊斯玛仪派和栽德派。十二伊玛目派尊奉阿里及其直系后裔中的12人为伊玛目（阿拉伯语意为指导者），强调真正安拉的旨意必体现在某个人身上，特别强调这一特殊人物具有无比权威，而这位独特领袖就是救世救人的伊玛目，伊朗前宗教领袖霍梅尼就属于这派。<br><br>

　　长期以来，伊斯兰教内什叶派和逊尼派两大派一直进行着激烈斗争，直到现在也没有停止。海湾地区是什叶派穆斯林集中的地区，但该地区除伊朗外全部是逊尼派掌权，什叶派一直在为争取改变这种不平等的政治权力分配而斗争。<br><br>

　　伊朗和伊拉克之所以长期不睦，一个很重要的原因就是两大教派之争。伊朗的穆斯林绝大多数属于什叶派，而伊拉克什叶派穆斯林虽占该国人口的55％，但不掌握国家权力，逊尼派处于领导地位。因此，历史上两派长期不和。伊拉克的什叶派受波斯文化影响深，同伊朗的什叶派认同感接近，而逊尼派则受阿拉伯文化影响较深。宗教因素再加上领土争端和民族矛盾，终于使两伊爆发了长达8年的战争。<br><br>

　　在中东地区根据宗教进行权力分配的惟一国家就是黎巴嫩。在1943年独立前，黎巴嫩各教派达成协议，总统由基督教人士担任，总理由伊斯兰教逊尼派担任，议会议长由什叶派人士担任，部长和议员根据教派人数按比例分配。<br><br>

　　逊尼派和什叶派是伊斯兰教的两个主要教派。逊尼和什叶都音译自阿拉伯语，前者意为“道路”，指在穆罕默德之后，接受艾布 伯克尔、欧麦尔、奥斯曼和阿里四大哈里发所确立的行为规范和准则；后者意为“追随者”，特指第四大哈里发阿里的追随者。<br><br>

　　在伊斯兰社会的领导权问题上，逊尼派承认四大哈里发和以后的伍麦叶王朝、阿拔斯王朝以及奥斯曼土耳其帝国哈里发的合法性；什叶派则认为只有阿里是穆罕默德的合法继承人，伊斯兰社会应该由阿里及其后裔领导，他们被尊称为伊马目。<br><br>

　　在教义方面，什叶派将信伊马目作为基本信条之一，而逊尼派对此却不予承认。由于在伊马目的数目和人选上存在分歧，什叶派又分为不同支派。其中主流为十二伊马目派，此外还有伊斯马仪派、宰德派等非主流派。<br><br>

　　在历史上，什叶派形成了包括大阿亚图拉、阿亚图拉和霍贾特伊斯兰在内的宗教学者等级制度，这在逊尼派里是没有的。什叶派规定信徒必须追随一位宗教学者，这使得高级宗教学者具有巨大的社会影响力。<br><br>

　　目前，逊尼派约占世界穆斯林总数的90％，什叶派约占10％。什叶派占人口多数的国家包括伊朗、伊拉克、巴林和阿塞拜疆，在黎巴嫩、也门、土耳其、沙特、阿联酋、科威特、叙利亚、阿富汗、印度和巴基斯坦等国也有一定数量。<br><br>

　　每年麦加朝圣期间，可见到一个有趣的特点，即什叶派信徒必然乘坐敞蓬（没有车顶的）巴士，而逊尼派则两种巴士不拘。<br><br>
<a href= "pic07.html">穆斯林人口统计</a><br><br>
　　两派之间法律的区别<br><br>

　　从法源角度来看，逊尼派公认四个法律源泉，即《古兰经》、圣训、公议和类比推理。而对什叶派来说，教法的根源只有三个，即《古兰经》、圣训和伊玛目的教法判决。<br><br>

　　在具体的部门法当中，什叶派教法与逊尼派教法的不同之处主要在于遗产继承和婚姻制度两个方面。在继承法方面，什叶派以血亲的权力为基本原则，规定了三类顺位继承人，他们分别是死者的直系后裔和父母，兄弟姐妹及其后裔及祖父母，叔伯姨婶及其后裔。这一分配方式强调家族成员的利益，与逊尼派保留氏族成员的特殊继承权力的做法不同。另外，在什叶派的继承原则中，女性和母系亲属都按照女儿或姐妹的份额类推继承，而在逊尼派中，这些人只是最后的顺位继承人，因此，女性享有较为有利的继承权。在婚姻方面，比较引人注目的是什叶派的临时婚姻制度。临时婚姻，即“穆塔尔”（mut‘ah）是一种穆斯林男子与无配偶之女子事先约定期限的婚姻形式。双方在婚前立契约为据，规定时限和女方应得的彩礼。正式婚姻所附带的权利和义务关系不完全适用于临时婚姻。比如，所生子女视为婚生子女，但是女方不享有赡养权和继承权。临时婚姻不为逊尼派教法所认可，而且当事人还可能面临私通的指控。但是，什叶派教法视这一做法为合法。<br><br>

　　逊尼派<br><br>

　　伊斯兰教主要派别之一。与什叶派、哈瓦利吉派、穆尔吉埃派并称为早期伊斯兰教的四大政治派别。全称“逊奈和大众派”，被认为是伊斯兰教的正统派。人数约占全世界穆斯林的90％；中国穆斯林绝大多数属于该派。<br><br>

　　形成<br><br>

　　656年第三任哈里发奥斯曼被刺后，叙利亚总督穆阿维叶对阿里继任哈里发表示不满。双方为争夺哈里发的职位爆发了隋芬之战。阿里在获胜的情况下，接受对方提出以《古兰经》裁判的和谈建议，从而出现了既反对穆阿维叶又反对阿里的哈瓦利吉派。<br><br>

　　661年初，阿里被哈瓦利吉派刺杀后，穆阿维叶取得了哈里发的职位。因此，围绕着哈里发问题的激烈争论，又形成了什叶派和穆尔吉埃派。什叶派不承认前三位哈里发和穆阿维叶作为哈里发的合法性。穆尔吉埃派对此则持温和态度，主张哈里发问题应“推延”到后世由安拉裁决。而多数人则承认四位哈里发的合法地位，但对穆阿维叶担任哈里发职位一事，既不表示反对，也不表示承认。他们除尊崇《古兰经》外，还特别强调以圣训为立法、立论的依据，故被称为遵守“逊奈”（圣训）的人们，即逊尼派。嗣后，该派在同哈瓦利吉派和什叶派的斗争过程中，建立了自己的政治思想体系，以后又在同穆尔太齐赖派的长期论争中，逐步建立了自己的神学、哲学和教法学体系。从而使初期的政治派别，转而成为宗教的派别。<br><br>

　　社会基础<br><br>

　　据史学家巴格达人赫蒂卜《派别分歧》一书的观点，逊尼派主要由八个方面的社会力量构成：<br><br>

　　①通晓一神论、先知的使命、预许与警告、赏与罚的律例以及通晓伊玛目与领袖的条件等学问的人；（注：逊尼派中伊玛目一词，完全没有什叶派中的宗教领导的含义，逊尼派一般用伊玛目一词称呼教义学、教法学、圣训学、经注学、哲学等领域的高级学者，以及各伊斯兰学派的思想、理论奠基人和其中的权威学者。因此，在历史上逊尼派内部有很多阿訇被称为伊玛目。）②在教法学方面坚持以教法学家的意见为立法原理的“意见派”和主张以圣训为立法依据的“圣训派”，这部分人中还包括主张按《古兰经》字面意义解释法律的查希里耶学派的学者；③精通圣训及其传述系统，并能辨别其真伪的圣训学家；④在文学、语法和辞法学方面坚持语言学大师们学说的库法学派、巴士拉学派的学者；⑤通晓逊尼派对《古兰经》的读法和注释的人；⑥主张听、视、心是人们辨别善恶的总中枢的苏非派修道者；⑦保卫穆斯林国土和尊严及逊尼派主张的卫士们；⑧各伊斯兰国家中坚持逊尼派各种主张的一般群众。<br><br>

　　政治主张<br><br>

　　坚持哈里发必须经过协商选举产生。但需具备五个方面的条件：①古来什族；②成年男子；③身心健康；④公正，有勇气、魄力以及有保卫领土所需要的其他性格特点；⑤为穆斯林所爱戴，并举行了臣服的仪式。哈里发在管理国家方面有如下的权力：保卫伊斯兰信仰和领土（特别是麦加和麦地那两大圣地）；必要时宣布圣战；任命国家官员；征收赋税，管理公共基金；讨伐叛逆；执行法律等。<br><br>

　　神学思想<br><br>

　　四大哈里发时期，国家版图扩展到叙利亚、伊拉克、波斯和北非等地。为了在被征服地区确立伊斯兰教的信仰，严格按经、训原则办事，以艾什尔里为代表的逊尼派教义学家针对穆尔太齐赖派的学说，进一步阐述了安拉的本体与德性、《古兰经》的无始性和前定与意志自由等问题，从而为该派信仰学奠定了理论基础。<br><br>

　　①安拉的本体与德性。认为安拉是宇宙间唯一的主宰，安拉的本体是第一性的，其德性是第二性的。本体和德性都是无始的、永存的。安拉的存在不同于万事万物的存在，他虽具有种种真实的德性，但决不与人同形、同性。宇宙间一切事物都是安拉创造的，它们仅仅是一些实体和“偶性”，而不具备安拉的种种德性。<br><br>

　　②《古兰经》的性质。认为《古兰经》是最高、最神圣的天经，是安拉的言语，是天使按照原型口授给穆罕默德的。它不是被造，而是无始和永存的。内在的启示并不寓于穆斯林的书、心、口、耳之中。<br><br>

　　③前定与意志自由。既承认安拉的前定，又承认个人有意志自由。认为安拉周知万物，过去和未来的事件完全在安拉的洞察之中。任何人和物都是安拉所创造的，因而人类的意志自由是在万能的安拉的意志下选择的，人能够掌握自己的行为，只是因为有辨别是非的能力，这种能力是在强制与自由之间发挥作用的。<br><br>

　　教法学思想<br><br>

　　一贯重视奉行穆罕默德的言行，并据以立法。创制教法的原则，第一，根据《古兰经》；第二，根据圣训；第三，如《古兰经》与圣训无明文规定，才采用“公议”，即遇有重大问题时，召集穆斯林领袖和著名教法学家商榷研究，做出决断；第四，当在经、训中找不到根据时，采用“类比”，即把所遇的问题同经训中与其类似的条文或案例加以比较，进行逻辑推论，从中找到共同点，借以立法断案。但在运用后两种原则时，由于各有侧重，遂有坚持以圣训立法和重视执法者个人见解的两种不同观点。同时由于所处地理环境不同，思维方法和所持依据各异，因而又产生以艾卜 哈尼法 努尔曼、马立克、沙斐仪和伊本 罕百勒为代表的不同法学思想派别。<br><br>

　　逊尼派教法学思想的特点在于：①维护哈里发国家的统治秩序，一般情况下教法学家是哈里发的代言人；②以忠实执行经、训原则，教法学家以不自作主张而著称，从而获得广大穆斯林特别是逊尼派穆斯林的拥护和支持；③逊尼派教法的出现结束了阿拉伯半岛无法可依的历史，大大发展和完善了穆罕默德及其门弟子所创制的教法，从而形成了系统的伊斯兰教法。<br><br>

　　对古兰学和圣训学的贡献<br><br>

　　逊尼派学者一贯重视《古兰经》和圣训在宗教上的价值，将其作为约束穆斯林言行,制定法律的重要理论根据,并对《古兰经》作了大量的注释。在注释中，他们坚持以古兰注释古兰或以圣训注释古兰。坚持《古兰经》的无始性，并遵从《古兰经》的字面意思，不妄加解释。著名的逊尼派经注家泰伯里的《古兰经解总汇》是该派早期经注代表作，对经注学的发展有很大影响。泰伯里以逊尼派的信仰观点指导经注，为该派经注学的先河。除经注外，该派历史上出现了许多圣训学学者。他们将圣训作为仅次于《古兰经》的又一重要经典，编辑、出版了六大圣训集。<br><br>

　　什叶派<br><br>

　　什叶派是以承认阿里为穆罕默德逝世后的合法继承人为标志的许多不同派别的总称。什叶派，原意为追随者，专指拥护阿里的人。什叶派信徒主要分布在西亚，其次是印巴大陆。我国新疆也有少数什叶派信徒。<br><br>

　　一．形成过程及发展<br><br>

　　什叶派原为阿里追随者组成的政治团体，后演变为宗教派别。什叶派称其宗教领袖为伊玛目（伊玛目，伊斯兰教用语，有多种含义：①穆斯林集体礼拜时，站在前面主持礼拜者。②清真寺的教长。③逊尼派用以称穆斯林的领袖，与哈里发同义；亦用以称著名的宗教学者和教法学派创始人。④什叶派用以称其所拥戴的政教领袖，以别于逊尼派的哈里发；以阿里为第一代伊玛目，其后裔继之。）。<br><br>

　　什叶派主张伊斯兰教的伊玛目应当由先知家族成员阿里的后裔来担任，但这一愿望从未实现过。什叶派在斗争中经历了许多挫折，其伊玛目都成了殉道者，或被杀害，或被毒死，传到十二代，伊玛目便后继无人了。什叶派只好认为最后一位伊玛目没有死，只是暂时隐遁起来；“隐遁的伊玛目”将作为救世主（马赫迪）重返于世。<br><br>

　　二．教义<br><br>

　　①伊玛目教义：阿里是穆罕默德的合法继承人，是第一位伊玛目，其后只有阿里和法蒂玛的后裔才是合法的伊玛目。伊玛目由安拉任命，谁也无权选举。伊玛目具有超凡的神性和“不谬性”。伊玛目是人与安拉之间的“中保”。只有伊玛目有权解释《古兰经》。<br><br>

　　②马赫迪教义：隐遁的伊玛目将在世界末日前再临人世，成为伊斯兰教的马赫迪（救世主），为世人伸张正义，恢复真正的伊斯兰教。<br><br>

　　③塔基亚教义：信徒在有危险的时候允许隐讳自己的宗教信仰，但这只是表面上否认之，内心还必须坚持信仰。<br><br>

　　此外，什叶派教义还承认临时婚姻制度“穆塔尔”。（穆塔尔是伊斯兰之前的阿拉伯社会习惯，先知穆圣曾经命令禁止，后来哈里法欧麦尔正式发布公告予以禁止，但仍旧有许多民族视为传统习惯。尤其长期旅居他乡的人，暗中实行。伊朗的现代婚姻法，对穆塔尔从法律上做了许多严格规定，改为双方志愿的“契约婚姻”或“商婚”的类型，以此杜绝嫖娼或通奸。）<br><br>

　　三．经典<br><br>

　　什叶派和逊尼派一样，都尊奉《古兰经》为唯一的经典，但认为奥斯曼定本在编辑时删除了有关阿里的经文。因此什叶派出版的《古兰经》补充了“二星宿”一章，用以比喻穆罕默德和阿里。什叶派最有权威的圣训集为“四圣书”。<br><br>

　　四．礼仪、圣地和节日<br><br>

　　什叶派的宗教礼仪与逊尼派大体相同，但在圣地和节日方面则有明显的区别。<br><br>

　　五．什叶派的派别<br><br>

　　什叶派在伊玛目的人数和谁是最后一位伊玛目的问题上后又发生分歧，形成了什叶派内部的不同派别。<br><br>

　　六．十二伊玛目派<br><br>

　　十二伊玛目派因尊崇阿里及其直系后裔十二人为伊玛目而得名。该派是什叶派中的主流派，人数最多，影响最大。<br><br>

　　七．栽德派<br><br>

　　栽德派由8世纪中叶第三代伊玛目侯赛因的孙子栽德 本 阿里的拥护者所组成。栽德派是什叶派中的温和派，其教义最接近逊尼派的观点，与其他什叶派派别有很大差别。<br><br>

　　八．伊斯玛仪派<br><br>

　　伊斯玛仪派，又称七伊玛目派，是什叶派的一个主要派别。伊斯玛仪派最基本的教义认为《古兰经》有表义和隐义的区别，表义即对经文公认的解释及经文所规定的教法；隐义即隐藏在经文和教法中的真理，这真理需要用神秘主义的方法--数字的秘密含义去阐释才能揭示。<br><br>

　　九．努赛里派<br><br>

　　努赛里派的信徒自称阿拉维派，意即阿里派。努赛里派的基本教义是承认阿里为真主的化身。<br><br>

　　十．阿里伊拉希派<br><br>

　　阿里伊拉希派是什叶派的极端派别之一。阿里伊拉希派的主要信条为阿里是真理的化身。<br><br>

　　伊斯兰教的什叶派和逊尼派历史和面面观<br><br>

　　什叶到底是怎样一个教派，其分布又是如何？<br><br>

　　当今回教世界中，什叶派是逊尼派主流之外最大支派，其源流可以一直追溯到回教史的最早期。什叶一词，在阿拉伯语中义谓党派，源自回教早期的“阿里党（什叶阿里）”，这里的阿里，便是伊斯兰先知穆罕默德的堂弟兼女婿。<br><br>

　　阿里作为穆罕默德的堂弟而娶其女儿法蒂玛为妻，似乎有违中国的辈分区别。但是从历史角度，这不仅是包括阿拉伯和犹太人的闪族文化风俗，也常常见于南北朝到隋唐时代的中国。唐朝著名诗人白居易的父母，便是舅舅和甥女结婚。<br><br>

　　什叶派的产生，起源于穆罕默德逝世之后，以阿拉伯半岛北部部落传统势力为一方，和强调先知本人宗教遗产的南部势力为另一方之间的分歧。<br><br>

　　当时阿里才三十岁出头，尽管他在传播和捍卫新兴宗教时贡献巨大，出于阿拉伯社会的尊老传统，第一任回教政教合一领袖哈里发（阿拉伯语“继承者”），由代表传统部落势力的阿布巴克出任。<br><br>

　　此后哈里发再传三传，都落在传统势力手中，刺激了回教内部的分歧。第三任哈里发遇刺后，在反对派的推举下，阿里终于出任第四任哈里发。<br><br>

　　但是阿里出任哈里发，反而加剧了回教内部的纷争，以至公开内战，并终于导致阿里在公元661年被政敌刺杀。此后阿里的儿子哈桑尽管“高票当选”哈里发，却被迫让位，让政敌登位而建立倭马亚王朝（中国《唐书》记载中称之为白衣大食），“阿里党”由此开始遭到大批迫害，甚至连阿里本人也遭到“批判”，什叶派也因之成形。<br><br>

　　因受迫害而隐瞒身份<br><br>

　　什叶派历史上的一个关键事件，是公元681年，阿里的另一个儿子胡赛因作为当时先知穆罕默德硕果仅存的外孙和“阿里党”的领袖，公开举起反抗主流派的大旗，在伊拉克的卡尔巴拉城战败被杀害。这一事件（以及阿里的被刺）成为今天什叶派悲情心结的历史起点。伊拉克萨达姆政权倒台后，4月下旬近百万什叶派信徒前往卡尔巴拉城朝圣，震动美国朝野，便是纪念胡赛因的殉难（回历每年正月初十）。<br><br>

　　从胡赛因殉难开始，什叶派一直代表了回教中的非主流派，受到主流派的压制、歧视和迫害。例如阿巴斯王朝（黑衣大食）利用什叶派力量推翻倭马亚王朝后，又反过来迫害什叶派信徒。但是这种逆境，也加深了什叶派的宗教信念和凝聚力。什叶派有一个自我隐瞒身份的“他欺也”教义原则，就是出于这一受迫害历史。<br><br>

　　据一般估计，在整个回教世界，什叶派约占10％。但由于“他欺也”原则（即：为应付逊尼派压制，允许隐瞒什叶派身份。）因此，这一比例可能低估。美国《基督教科学箴言报》，便估计中东地区什叶派人口有1亿2500万，占本地回教总人口的12％以上。<br><br>

　　在长期的历史发展中，什叶派有分化出好些支系，现存主要有三大分支。<br><br>

　　第一，十二伊玛目宗，是什叶派的最大宗派，主要分布在伊朗、伊拉克和波斯湾其他地区（包括沙地阿拉伯东部），其他分布在阿塞拜疆（原伊朗领土）、阿富汗、黎巴嫩、叙利亚、印度次大陆等地。<br><br>

　　第二，五伊玛目宗，主要分布在也门，据称占当地人口40％之众。<br><br>

　　第三，伊斯马义宗（也称七伊玛目宗），主要分布在印度、中亚、伊朗、叙利亚、东非等地。<br><br>

　　另外，目前控制叙利亚的阿萨德父子政权，属于阿拉维教派，也算是什叶派的一个支派。现代已经成为世界性宗教的巴哈依教，早先也出自什叶派一支。<br><br>

　　在上述提及的地区之外，什叶派的分布非常广泛，从中国新疆到亚洲各地，都有人数不明的什叶派。但是因为主流派的压制和他欺也原则，其具体情况常常扑朔迷离。例如马来西亚曾经宣布什叶派为非法，证明东南亚也有潜在的什叶派温床。<br><br>

　　什叶派信奉“伊玛目”教义<br><br>

　　在伊拉克，巴格达以西50公里的费卢杰镇，是萨达姆执政复兴党的据点，也是逊尼派回教徒的聚居地。<br><br>

　　什叶派与逊尼派在宗教教义上的最大区别，是什叶派信奉的伊玛目教义。伊玛目一词在阿拉伯文中原来只是指祈祷主持人，在逊尼派中仍然如此，可是在什叶派中却有极为重要的意义，代表上帝和世人之间的中介，具有半神半人的地位。按什叶派教义，伊玛目来自先知的家属后代，阿里及其两子是什叶派所有各宗共同供奉的最早三位伊玛目，其下则视各宗而不免有所同异。<br><br>

　　以十二伊玛目宗为例，该宗认定从阿里开始，总共有过十二位伊玛目，前十一名过世后，第十二名伊玛目遁世隐没，在世界末日之前会复现于世。由于历史根源，什叶派特别尊崇以阿里及其子孙代表的先知的亲属后代。在什叶派的影响下，逊尼派也不得不为倭马亚王朝时期遭到批判的阿里“平反”，但是其在逊尼派信徒中的地位还是不能与什叶派相比。<br><br>

　　顺便说一下，阿里和法蒂玛所生的子女后代，是先知穆罕默德的唯一后裔。什叶派尊崇阿里及其子孙，并不意味“圣裔”都自动成为什叶派。例如元朝名臣咸阳王赛典赤赡思丁是先知圣裔，也是中国许多回族家庭的祖先。但并无任何证据表明赡思丁是什叶派。<br><br>

　　出于历史原因，什叶派的一个显著特点是悲情主义和所谓弥赛亚（救世主）情结，常常表现出很强的宗教热情。在卡尔巴拉朝圣期间见到的自我鞭笞和号哭，是典型例子。什叶派被认为比逊尼派激进，多半是出于这一宗教感情。<br><br>

　　什叶派不承认阿里之前三个哈里发的合法性，有额外的宗教节日，婚姻规定有差别等等。此外和逊尼派的具体宗教仪式差别不是太大。但是每年麦加朝圣期间，却可见到一个有趣的特点，即什叶派信徒必然乘坐敞蓬（没有车顶的）巴士，而逊尼派则两种巴士不拘。<br><br>

　　什叶派的起源悠久，并且在回教世界的分布广泛，但是它基本上一直是个少数派，为什么能在波斯湾地区成为主导性的多数力量呢？这个问题，和伊朗历史密切相关。<br><br>

　　伊朗和其他中东回教国家的一个关键差别，是它不同于阿拉伯文明的“先伊斯兰”文化，这一古老文化播及的范围，从埃及和两河流域（相当于今天的伊拉克），一直延伸到中国西部。<br><br>

　　例如基督教《圣经》的许多故事和伊朗有关，《马太福音》叙述耶稣出生时前来朝拜的几个东方贤人（新加坡圣经公会译为博士），原词是古伊朗的教士（单数magus，复数magi）。近年在陕西的考古发现表明，连中国的“巫”，也可能起源于这个伊朗古词。伊拉克首都巴格达一名也来自伊朗语，义为“神赐”。<br><br>

　　波斯湾成反主流温床<br><br>

　　回教在阿拉伯半岛兴起后迅速扩张，征服了以祆教（拜火教）为国教的波斯（伊朗）萨珊王朝。这里一段有趣史实，是波斯和其他一些祆教属国面临阿拉伯入侵，不断寻求唐朝的援助，萨珊朝亡国之君的王子卑路斯，流亡并死在中国。唐朝也支持波斯复国。<br><br>

　　唐玄宗天宝十载（751年），朝鲜族名将高仙芝率领唐朝和中亚各国联军，与阿拉伯军队在中亚怛逻斯河畔苦战五天，最终因突厥葛罗禄军临阵叛变而大败。据中亚史专家断言，如果唐军在怛逻斯战役中获胜，不仅伊朗可望复国，中亚今天将会是说华语的儒教－佛教文化区，无回教立足之地。一战之差，改变了世界历史。<br><br>

　　暴力征服的结果，是在伊朗和其他被迫回教化的地区，长期存在反对阿拉伯统治的暗流，而反主流的回教什叶派，不免和这一股反抗暗流汇合，使得波斯湾地区一直是什叶派的温床。什叶派认为第四位伊玛目的生母是波斯萨珊王朝的公主，便是明证。<br><br>

　　什叶派的一个重要转机，是1258年元宪宗蒙哥母弟旭烈兀受命攻占巴格达，处死回教阿巴斯王朝最后一任哈里发，逊尼派主流几遭灭顶打击，群龙无首，长期受压制的什叶派得到前所未有的发展机遇。<br><br>

　　旭烈兀后来经兄长元世祖忽必烈封授，建立伊朗伊利汗国，其主要谋士便是什叶派。学者们因此认为：蒙古征服是什叶派十二伊玛目宗在伊朗扎根的时代。后来库尔德族萨法维家族在伊朗建立萨法维王朝，此时土耳其奥斯曼帝国逐渐征服了大部分阿拉伯地区，奥斯曼苏丹自封哈里发，以全世界回教正统领袖自居。<br><br>

　　伊朗因为有和阿拉伯文化不同的独立传统，坚持和回教主流势力分庭抗礼，萨法维王朝宣布以十二伊玛目宗为伊朗国教，确立了什叶派主导伊朗的事实，同时推动什叶派在伊朗文化圈和旧有领土内不断扩展，逐渐造成今天什叶派在波斯湾的盛况。<br><br>

　　逊尼派的长期压迫<br><br>

　　同属波斯湾地区的伊拉克今天的什叶派多数，与近邻伊朗有密切的关系，但是伊拉克本身也具有什叶派滋长的天然土壤。举例而言，最后一位“遁世”不计，十一名伊玛目中，六位墓地在伊拉克，葬在今天伊朗境内的只有一位。特别是第一任伊玛目、什叶派心目中的“亚圣”阿里，葬于伊拉克什叶派重镇纳杰夫，加上第三任伊玛目胡赛因殉难和葬身之地卡尔巴拉，成为世上所有什叶派最重要的两个圣地。再如伊朗什叶派领袖霍梅尼在1960年代遭到放逐，曾长期住在伊拉克，酝酿伊斯兰革命。总之，伊拉克成为伊朗之外的另一个什叶派重地。<br><br>

　　既然有这样的地理背景和人口现实，伊拉克的什叶派为什么在过去一直处于被统治被压制的地位？这里有历史和现实政治多种原因。<br><br>

　　自从穆罕默德逝世，直到蒙古征服，巴格达始终是“回教教皇”哈里发的首都，压制少数派什叶派自然不遗余力。此后伊拉克大部归属奥斯曼帝国，奥斯曼苏丹自封哈里发，也不会允许什叶派出头。<br><br>

　　一次大战之后奥斯曼帝国崩溃，英法两国一反原先帮助阿拉伯各国独立的许诺，食言而肥，瓜分阿拉伯世界。英国在伊拉克扶植了来自阿拉伯半岛的逊尼派哈希姆傀儡王朝，实质上实施殖民统治。伊拉克什叶派从1920年代起，成为反对英国统治的伊拉克民族主义的中坚，因此遭到英国当局的镇压和专门防范。在非殖化和伊拉克哈希姆王朝垮台时，居人口多数的伊拉克什叶派却错过掌权机会。<br><br>

　　错过掌权机会也造成什叶派对西方的深刻敌视。从1920年代起，主要什叶派学者纷纷着重批判西方特别是英国帝国主义，反对西方对世界的支配控制，成为现代什叶派意识形态和宗教理论的有机部份。<br><br>

　　伊朗伊斯兰革命中爆发的反美浪潮，使得美国在过去二十多年中，一直以扶持逊尼派阿拉伯政权抑制什叶派，作为在回教世界的基本政策。随即发生苏联入侵阿富汗，促使美国非常短视地鼓励“伊斯兰圣战”，来遏制苏联的扩张。这样的政策，终于造成萨达姆坐大和沙地阿拉伯逊尼派瓦哈比原教旨极端主义在回教世界泛滥成灾的双重恶果，又增加什叶派对美国的强烈敌意。<br><br>

　　第一次海湾战争结束之际，伊拉克什叶派在美国煽动下大批起义，反抗萨达姆。可是华盛顿又担心什叶派借机壮大，始乱终弃，听任起义者被萨达姆残酷镇压。<br><br>

　　与逊尼派的政教合一传统不同，什叶派历史上主张政教分离。目前伊拉克什叶派的一位最高权威继续强调宗教应该超越政治，因此，至今为止绝大多数回教极端恐怖分子属于逊尼派。但是，什叶派组织也有逊尼派不及的经济资源：按照先知穆罕默德家庭曾经享有的特权，什叶派教会的宗教税率为百分之二十，是基督教会传统什一税的两倍。<br><br>

　　什叶派与逊尼派之间的敌意和善意<br><br>

　　什叶派和逊尼派之间的分歧，自伊斯兰诞生之初就已经存在，但是不代表两派之间就不能和睦相处。<br><br>

　　比如：在巴格达南部的小城卡达米亚发生的反美战斗中，有目击者证实，逊尼和什叶两派的人都参与了与美军的作战。目击者称：“参加战斗的人有的是萨德尔城的什叶派，有的是费卢杰的逊尼派。现在，抵抗力量已经团结起来。”一座清真寺的墙上插出了这样一面旗子，上面写着：“我们在阿达米亚的旗帜和卡达米亚的旗帜是一样的，如果他们有了麻烦，我们就是他们的后援和他们的右手。”传统上，阿达米亚是逊尼派居住区，卡达米亚是什叶派居住区。两个居住区由底格里斯河上的一座桥连接。现在，当地人说，民兵常常走过这座桥，到对面去商讨袭击美军的事。一些伊拉克人甚至表示：“现在我们在为政府工作，可是如果发生了那种事，我们就会为萨德尔而战。”<br><br>

　　在伊拉克、叙利亚、约旦、黎巴嫩、阿富汗和巴基斯坦，两派的高级学者和宗教领袖们同意两派别的民众互相交流，到对方清真寺参加活动，允许跟随彼此的伊玛目礼拜，互相通婚。在国际上，两个教派的领袖们参加共同的会议，遵循《古兰经》和圣训为穆斯林世界的利益坚持一致的立场。什叶穆斯林的伊玛目和领导人主动宣传和号召穆斯林世界的团结，消除分歧。<br><br>

　　两派之间的讹传和误解<br><br>

　　美国华盛顿的伊斯兰学者AqSq哈希姆博士和底特律什叶清真寺伊玛目穆罕默德 埃拉赫是美国著名的什叶派伊斯兰学者，他们列举了以下逊尼穆斯林对什叶穆斯林弟兄的讹传和误解，并予解答。<br><br>

　　讹传之一：什叶派穆斯林有不同版本的《古兰经》，在原经中增加了十章经文。<br><br>

　　什叶派学者解答：绝不属实。在任何一个什叶穆斯林家中或清真寺里的《古兰经》只有全世界统一的版本，从来没有看到过阿拉伯原文的《古兰经》有一字之差的不同版本。但是，翻译的《古兰经》波斯语译文，确实有不同译者的作品，或波斯文注释不同，这是世界各国《古兰经》翻译文的正常现象，在许多国家都有两种以上本民族文字的《古兰经》译文。可以肯定地说，任何翻译都免不了对原文做些诠注，但从来没有看到过对原经有所增加的新版本。<br><br>

　　讹传之二：什叶派穆斯林认伊玛目阿里为造物主。<br><br>

　　什叶派学者解答：纯属造谣，没有任何什叶穆斯林敢这么说。敢这么说的人，绝对不是穆斯林，因为什叶穆斯林与逊尼派一样，把为主举伴视为不可饶恕的第一大罪过。<br><br>

　　考查历史资料，在阿里担任哈里法时代，据说在古波斯帝国边远地方有一个加勒特部落，他们在归信伊斯兰之初曾经把哈里法阿里依照当地的信仰习惯说成是“神君”。伊玛目阿里得知后立即帕特使去制止，如有人再如此说，必予严厉惩罚。<br><br>

　　讹传之三：什叶穆斯林的“清真言”不同。<br><br>

　　什叶派学者解答：绝非如此。逊尼与什叶穆斯林的清真言都是：“万物非主，唯有安拉；穆罕默德是安拉的使者。”在接纳新穆斯林归信伊斯兰时，有些地方的什叶伊玛目要求宣誓者在清真言之后加上一句话承认伊玛目阿里是真主的忠仆，是穆斯林社会的领袖，但绝大部份什叶伊玛目没有这个要求，采用与逊尼穆斯林完全一样的归信誓言。<br><br>

　　讹传之四：什叶穆斯林拜功中只有主命拜，没有圣行拜。<br><br>

　　什叶派学者解答：并非如此。在什叶穆斯林每天五次拜功中的主命拜拜数与逊尼派相同，而且此外还有总共36拜附属的“志愿拜”(纳瓦菲尔)，不称作圣行拜。此外，什叶穆斯林也有许多个人的志愿拜功，但都不是以圣行的名称，因为，作为圣行拜便有“必须性”，而志愿拜则强调记念真主的自觉性。<br><br>

　　讹传之五：什叶伊玛目说，哲卜利勒天使犯了一个错误，真主命令他把启示传达给“先知胡德”，应当是阿里，而不是穆罕默德。<br><br>

　　什叶派学者解答：没有此事。从来没有一部什叶经典有这个荒唐记载，也从来没有一个伊玛目有如此梦呓狂言。什叶穆斯林同逊尼派一样，绝对承认先知穆罕默德是真主派遣到人世间的封印至圣，没有其它猜疑和传说。<br><br>

　　讹传之六：什叶伊玛目对前三位哈里法(阿布 伯克o欧麦尔和奥斯曼)不予承认，认为先知穆圣合法的继承者只有是阿里；什叶穆斯林喜欢法蒂玛太太，不喜欢圣妻阿依莎。<br><br>

　　什叶派学者解答：不确切。根据什叶伊斯兰的历史记载，上述前三位大贤都是先知穆圣最亲密的弟子，而且人品高尚，政绩显赫，成就卓越，但不如第四位哈里法阿里有伊斯兰大伊玛目的品级，因为伊玛目阿里是先知穆圣亲自教育和培养的青年，属于《古兰经》上所肯定的圣裔，他本人和他的后代得真主特赐护佑。此外，这是历史的争论，与伊斯兰信仰的精神和基本教义没有直接关系。四位哈里法都是当时选举产生的，这是伊斯兰民主的榜样，如果当时有一位弟子在选举中没有举手赞同，这不会影响他的现代子孙成为忠诚的穆斯林。<br><br>

　　根据什叶穆斯林的历史，什叶派的第六位大伊玛目加法尔 萨迪克的曾祖母和母亲都是阿布 伯克尔的后裔，因此，伊玛目萨迪克说：“哈里法阿布 伯克尔曾经给过我两次生命。” 圣妻阿依莎也被什叶穆斯林同样尊称为“信士之母”，是伊玛目阿里所尊敬的长辈，在先知穆圣归真之后发生的“骆驼之战”的战役中，伊玛目阿里命令把圣妻阿依莎从巴什拉护送到麦地那，保护她的人身安全。对伊斯兰历史上的前三位哈里法或圣妻阿依莎如果有任何歪曲历史的狂言，那可能是什叶穆斯林之中无知之徒的胡诌，不足为凭。<br><br>

　　讹传之七：什叶穆斯林把全天五次拜功合并，在晚间作一次礼。<br><br>

　　什叶派学者解答：一叶障目。说话的人大概只看某一个到在美国打工的什叶穆斯林，他也许整天劳动，晚上还补全天拜功。只有这样的人，才把一天的拜在晚上并礼，而在所有什叶清真寺中，同逊尼穆斯林一样，按时的五次拜功，一点也不差，时间的定制也完全一样。什叶伊玛目强调按时礼拜是真主的命令，并礼是万不得已的补救，但比找借口“工作太忙”从来不礼拜的人要算有进取的优秀穆斯林，即使中午或晚上，把两次以上拜功并礼，也必须明显分段，每次举意不同。此外，每周一次星期五主麻聚礼，每年两次节日会礼（开斋节和宰牲节）什叶与逊尼穆斯林没有区别。<br><br>

　　讹传之八：什叶穆斯林不执行则卡特制度（天课）。<br><br>

　　什叶派学者解答：不实之言。每年从纯收入中交纳四十分之一的则卡特如同逊尼穆斯林奉行的同样制度，什叶穆斯林的则卡特多数是直接向贫穷户资助和施舍，不必经过政府部门收敛。什叶穆斯林另外还有“库姆斯”课税制度，把收入的五分之一(20%)拿出来用作公益事业。<br><br>

　　讹传之九：什叶穆斯林施行“穆塔尔”临时婚姻，歧视妇女。<br><br>

　　什叶派学者解答：“穆塔尔”是伊斯兰之前的阿拉伯社会习惯，先知穆圣曾经命令禁止，后来哈里法欧麦尔正式发布公告予以禁止，但仍旧有许多民族视为传统习惯，尤其长期旅居他乡的人，暗中实行。伊朗的现代婚姻法，对穆塔尔从法律上做了许多严格规定，改为双方志愿的“契约婚姻”或“商婚”的类型，以此杜绝嫖娼或通奸。<br><br>

　　讹传之十：什叶穆斯林认为他们的伊玛目具有“永无错误”的品级，超越历代先知。<br><br>

　　什叶派学者解答：不确实。先知（纳比）是真主派遣的使者，例如《古兰经》中所记载的那些先知，都经过真主的特派，承担特殊使命，并且经历真主对他们的各种磨难和考验。虽然所有的先知也都是伊玛目，例如穆罕默德是先知，也是伊玛目，因为伊玛目是社会功能，是伊斯兰信士的领袖，但并非任何伊玛目都是先知，这应当是常识。什叶穆斯林所敬仰的领袖如阿里，以及以后的领袖，他们只是伊玛目，而不能与先知相提并论。<br><br>


在2012年年底公布的《皮尤研究中心》报告，其“宗教与公共生活论坛”，特别关注全球与西方国家穆斯林发展趋势。 该研究所人口统计专家康拉德・哈凯特在一篇新闻分析文章中说：“穆斯林人口年轻化的倾向，使他们成为国际事务的重要角色。”  根据他最近发表的“全球宗教人口景观”，穆斯林人口已突破十六亿大关，占全球69亿人口的23%。 他说，穆斯林分为两大宗派：逊尼穆斯林（87-90%）和什叶穆斯林（10-13%），他们共同坚守“万物非主，唯有真主；穆罕默德是真主的使者”信条。 《皮尤》是美国的一家独立的民办社会民调研究机构，保持政治上“无倾向性”。“宗教人口景观”资料来源于两千五百项各国人口普查、研究与统计报告。<br><br>

虽然传统的穆斯林都集中在亚洲和非洲，但现代趋势向欧洲和美洲逐渐蔓延，在许多过去没有穆斯林的地方都出现了新穆斯林社区，如西欧、南美洲和加勒比海地区。  穆斯林居民最集中的地方是亚太地区，占当地人口的62%，每十个人中有六人是穆斯林；欧洲有6%，南北美洲穆斯林最少，只有1%。<br><br>
<a href= "pic07.html">穆斯林人口统计</a><br><br>
穆斯林人口占多数的国家有五十个，最新的一个国家是科索沃，这五十个国家几乎囊括了全部穆斯林的四分之三，73%。 中东和北非有20个国家的一片大版块，其中19个是伊斯兰国家。<br><br>

有十个国家的穆斯林人口构成了全部人口的三分之二，66%。 这十个国家分别是印度尼西亚、印度、巴基斯坦、孟加拉国、尼日利亚、埃及、伊朗、土耳其、阿尔及利亚和摩洛哥。 印度穆斯林算作是“少数民族”，占人口的14%，但人数却有一亿六千万，是一个穆斯林大国。<br><br>

穆斯林在世界不同宗教族群中，是平均年龄最年轻的一组。 全球的人口总体平均年龄是28岁，而穆斯林的平均年龄是23岁，年轻五岁，半数穆斯林都是23岁以下的年轻人。 他们在未来的世界舞台上将散发更大活力。<br><br>

研究报告说：“根据我们所获得的最新资料，每个地区的穆斯林都低于当地的平均年龄，他们是那里最年轻的人群。”  撒哈拉非洲地区穆斯林平均年龄为17岁；中东与北非为23岁；亚太地区为24岁；美洲为26岁；欧洲为32岁。 其中，北美与欧洲出现人口老年化现象，穆斯林平均年龄在美洲是26岁与当地人37岁相比，欧洲则是32岁与40岁相比。 在人口众多的亚洲太平洋地区，双方平均年龄是24岁与28岁之比。<br><br>

英国内政部最近公布的人口普查资料表明，对照上次人口普查报告，穆斯林人口快速增长，从3%跳跃到4.8%，从宗教人口角度看，伊斯兰是发展最为快速的宗教族群。 这种现象在美国也同样发生，有最近的芝加哥人口调查资料为证，穆斯林居民人口超越平均增长率。 美国社会调查机构惊讶地发现，在过去的十年，各种媒体在宗教类中有关伊斯兰事件的报道占据了新闻主流，成为每天新闻必不可少的一部分，打破了公共媒体历来回避宗教问题的传统。 世界各国的媒体都在身不由己地关注穆斯林的动态，无意之中对伊斯兰的强大生命力和穆斯林的坚定信仰做了广泛宣传。 <br><br>

	<b><a name="T19">伊斯法罕</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
 “伊斯法罕半天下”，来到伊斯法罕的人多数都是冲着这句话来的。它也是座古老的城市，在萨法维王朝时期（相当于中国的明朝）达到全盛，那时商贾云集，八方宾客汇聚，被称为中东的佛罗伦萨。<br><br>
<a href= "pic08.html">伊朗旅游地图</a><br><br>
 伊斯法罕是伊朗最古老的城市之一，建于公元前4、5世纪的阿黑门尼德王朝时期，多次成为王朝首都。为南北来往所必经之路，著名的手工业与贸易中心<br><br>
“伊斯法罕”一名源自波斯文“斯帕罕”，意思是“军队”，古时这里曾是军队的集结地，由此而得名。<br><br>
公元11、12世纪塞尔柱王朝时，该市曾为首都。萨法维王朝时期（1501－1736年），该市处于全盛时期，商贾云集，八方宾客汇聚，市内多数建筑物和清真寺都是那时建造的。伊有谚语说“伊斯法罕半天下”，反映了该市当时的繁荣景象和深远影响。<br><br>


那天到了伊斯法罕已经天黑了，我们住在33孔桥附近，就踱过去看夜景。扎因德鲁河是伊斯法罕的母亲河，据说现在只有四，五月有水，我们算是来对了时间。它的河北面多数是萨珊王朝建，比较老，好比上海的浦西，河南面多数是萨法维王朝时期建，好比上海的浦东新区。南面多数是亚美尼亚的能工巧匠建的，现在还住着相当数量信奉基督教的亚美尼亚人。不过他们还是要根据伊朗现行的法律戴头巾并且不得喝酒。<br><br>

 更多资讯，请访问：<a href= "http://www.retter2012.com" title="点击进入"> retter2012.com </a>。<br><br>

 夜晚的33孔桥美极了，33孔的桥洞倒映在河里，流光溢彩。桥上很热闹，有很多年轻人三三两两地聚集在桥上。他们通常喜欢坐在桥上的拱形门洞里，或看着来来往往的行人，或望着河水小声交谈着。由于有很多年轻人，桥上的气氛很欢乐。这里的女孩子穿着还是很保守的，但是人却很开放。我们听到一阵欢乐的尖叫，然后就有一群穿黑色布卡的女孩向我们奔来。她们会说英语，还有几个男生同行，很期待地要求和我们拍照。从外貌和语言来看，很可能是一群大学生。我们很愉快地和他们拍了照片，分享着这份喜悦。<br><br>
我听导游说，伊斯兰教固然对女性有很多限制，可是伊朗人却是尊重女性的民族。因此，虽然这里的女孩子现在要遵守着装要求，但是她们还是拥有很多伊斯兰社会其它地方的女人没有的自由和权利的。她们可以开车，和男孩子一样接受教育。女孩和男孩在小学到中学是分开男女校学习的，但在幼儿园或大学以后都是男女生混合的学校。目前伊朗的大学里女生比例还高于男生。很多女孩读书用功，功课普遍比男生好，有些大学为了平衡男女生比例，还提出了女生录取分数线高于男生的解决方案。这和中国还蛮像的呢。女孩子就业，除了不能做那些所谓“抛头露面”的工作外（如演员，餐馆服务员），是不受限制的。因此受了高等教育的女性就会大量在专业人士的领域就业（如医生，教师，律师等）。伊斯兰教的教义是允许男人娶四个妻子的，但是导游告诉我们在伊朗几乎没有人这么做，因为不忠于自己的妻子是与波斯人的传统相违背的。另外伊朗法律规定，男人如有10种情况之一，女人可以立即申请离婚，法院24小时内判决。伊朗还有一个传统，就是婚前女性可以要求男方一定数量的金币作为订金，离婚时，全额归属女方来给女人一定的保障。我一向认为，尊重保护女性是社会文明的标志。如果伊朗真是如此，它再次证明了自己是有文化有教养的民族。<br><br>

 

 扎因德鲁河上还有另一座优美的桥--哈鸠大桥。和33孔桥一样，这座桥是17世纪萨法维王朝所建，不但用来行人，还有水坝的作用。桥的两边都是过去的皇家花园，两侧各有一头狮子，看起来一模一样，可仔细看却发现这两头狮子，一头拥有一张欢乐的脸，另一头拥有一张悲伤的脸。这是否和波斯人善恶二元论的宗教观念有关呢？还是想表达人有悲欢离合，月有阴晴圆缺？<br><br>
那天是周五，伊朗的休息日，因为周五是聚礼拜日。伊朗人一般一周只有这一天休息，所以在哈鸠大桥附近到处可见出来休闲的伊朗人。他们多数会在桥洞下或水边的一片荫凉下铺开一块地毯，亲朋好友在一起喝茶，聊天。也有恋人坐在水边戏水或静静地望着河水奔流。和33孔桥一样，这座桥有很多拱形的桥洞，走在桥上桥下都能透过那一道弧线看到一片湛蓝的湖水，宁静而优美。<br><br>

四十柱王宫并没有四十根柱子，而是二十根，另外的二十根是水中的倒影。另一说是“四十”在波斯语里就像中国的“三”，是个虚数，多的概念。四十柱王宫比格列斯坦宫要素雅很多，很明显萨法维王朝的审美观比卡加王朝含蓄很多。我个人好像更爱这种风格。也是进门先看到水池，王宫就在水池的那头，静静地投落它的身影在池中。柱子和中国古代的一样是木柱，那木头的颜色颇为古朴雅致。每根木柱由四头石狮驼着，据说这些石狮代表帝国统辖之下的诸侯王，表示萨法维王朝的国王是王中之王。天花板是蓝色的，缀有黄色，金色的星星点点，代表天空。天花板下有一水池，倒映着天空。<br><br>

这座宫殿是萨法维王朝赫赫有名的阿巴斯大帝所建，主要用来接待外国使节。目前收藏了很多经典的细密画，表现了当时的种种历史和生活场面。有国王讨伐叛军，有与印度大象军团交战，有阿巴斯大帝接见新疆使臣，和土耳其使臣，也有男女谈情，仕女图。细密画很有些像中国的工笔画，画得很细，很真。用的颜料全是天然的植物和矿物中提炼的。<br><br>


宫殿的四围都是皇家花园，柏树青翠，玫瑰盛开。这里到处是各种品种和颜色的玫瑰。我们去的时间，已是最后的玫瑰时节，可那繁花似锦，郁郁葱葱，还是让我流连忘返，完全忘记了自己其实是身处一个干热的沙漠戈壁国家。<br><br>


我们在伊斯法罕拜访的另一座宫殿是阿里卡普王宫。它和四十柱宫一样风格淡雅，由阿巴斯大帝建造。两座王宫都在一场阿富汗人的叛乱中遭到严重毁坏，阿里卡普宫好像更严重，很多墙上的花纹都被抹去了，只能从穹顶，台阶等处窥到当时装饰的一斑。最漂亮的是楼上保存相当完好的音乐室。墙上有很多镂空的花纹，仔细看，描绘的都是波斯的各种乐器。据说这些花纹不仅是为了装饰美观，而且有很好的隔音效果。<br><br>


阿里卡普宫当时主要是用来供王公贵族们娱乐的，因此在阿里卡普宫下造了大大的伊玛目广场（据说是世界上最大的广场）。当时的伊玛目广场上常常会有马球赛，王公贵族们就坐在阿里卡普宫的观景平台上欣赏。现在站在那座平台上俯视广场，还是视角很好的地方。<br><br>


说到广场，我们真是幸运，那天是休息日，广场上欢腾一片。孩子们在水池喷泉里尽情地戏水，玩得全身湿透，十几岁的男孩，女孩骑着自行车飞来飞去。有一个男孩看到我们在看他，很显摆地表演起他的自行车杂技，大概十二三岁的男孩，但玩起他的车来好帅好拉风的。我的相机对准他，留下他追风少年的灿烂笑容。更多的是广场四围到处可见的席地喝茶的人们。又受到一户人家的热情邀请，和他们共饮一杯。这里的人真的对中国人很友好的。我们曾遇到过一辆小汽车从我们身边经过，司机探出头来问，“QingNing?”我们微笑点头，他居然双手脱把，从车窗里伸出两只手来跟我们握手。我们马上伸手和他握了，生怕时间久了，他要出车祸。还有一位妇人，站在马路牙子上，看我们过马路，就对着我们大喊：“QingNing?”我们点头，她居然立即跑到马路中央，也不顾来往车辆，伸出手来热情地和我们握手。这些事，在我们的旅途中常常遇到，都是很温暖人心的意外相逢。<br><br>


这座广场上还有两座清真寺。伊玛目清真寺和谢赫卢特夫劳清真寺。伊玛目清真寺胜在大，谢赫卢特夫劳清真寺则胜在气氛，我更爱的是后者。<br><br>

 

 就先说说我偏爱的吧。它是皇室御用的礼拜场所，谢赫卢特夫劳是一位黎巴嫩的学者，阿巴斯一世很敬重他，就以他的名字命名了这座清真寺。它是个纯粹的礼拜室，没有很多大清真寺所有的建筑群，可是我一踏进去，心立刻静下来了。大大的穹顶上有一个空洞，一束金色的光线从那里透下来，整个穹顶像孔雀开屏一般。穹顶下围着一排花窗，光线透过花窗，射在墙上，留下一串美丽的光斑。清真寺里只有几个人，他们散坐在地上，靠着墙，像我们一样完全被震慑了。我们也坐下来，沉浸在一种充满喜悦的宁静里。这是我在伊朗最喜欢的一座清真寺，在那里，我觉得离神比较近了一点。<br><br>


我对伊玛目清真寺事先怀着很高的期待，因为很多地方都有介绍它是世界上最伟大的建筑物之一。很可惜的是当天我们并没有看到多少，因为清真寺内部用铁架和帆布到处搭满了蓬，据说是供人们在此举行大型的礼拜活动。这样一来，好多地方都去不了也看不到了。最有趣的是拱顶下的回音石，在回音石附近打响指，唱歌，说话，回音效果都很明显。还听到一个有趣的故事：建造伊玛目清真寺的是一位很有名的建筑师，他参建过伊斯坦布尔的清真寺和印度的泰姬陵。可是在穹顶刚完成后，这位建筑师就不见了，6年后他才回来。国王问他为何不辞而别，他解释说，当时国王建造这座清真寺，一心想和奥斯曼土耳其的伊斯坦布尔比，所以如果他在穹顶造好后告诉国王要让穹顶干6年后再上色才能保持长久，国王一定没有那个耐心等。于是他只好消失6年来完成自己对这个建筑高品质的追求。这个故事挺能打动人心的，在君主时代，这样做是有性命之忧的。那位建筑师为了追求品质而冒这样大的风险，他的职业精神令人钦佩。可是我总在想，如果这位国王真的这样着急，难道全波斯找不到第二个人会把穹顶上漆，把清真寺盖完吗？不过不管怎样，我喜欢这个故事。<br><br>


当天晚上，我们决定再去一次33孔桥。这一次我们邀请司机Mehran跟我们同行。Mehran英语不好，所以我们交谈不多，可是我们都很喜欢安安静静，善良又乐于助人的他。到了33孔桥，我反而有些不安了，因为我们和Mehran语言不通，所以我很怕我们三个说说笑笑，冷落了Mehran。可是他的英语实在不足以和我们聊天。一会儿他走开了一下，我正在想他会不会不高兴了，见他走回来，对我们招招手。我们跟着他走下桥，沿着河，他突然很高兴地往前一指，啊，我们恍然大悟，原来这个角度看33孔桥夜里的灯光特别美。有个看起来是专业摄影师模样的人正在此地架着三角架拍照呢。我们也举起相机，拍下了昨夜未曾捕捉到的美景。我们在河边坐了一会儿，Mehran用很有限的英语词汇开始艰难的跟我们说起了什么。好半天终于懂了，他说伊斯法罕最好的酒店叫阿巴斯酒店，非常漂亮，建议我们去看看。可是我们记得他45分钟后有事的，就问他还来得及吗？他说我们打的去吧。于是我们叫了辆车，直奔阿巴斯酒店。那酒店确实很漂亮，有个大大的庭院，坐满了喝茶的客人。Mehran打电话把他原来约了的事推后了一小时，很热情地请我们尝试了一次阿巴斯酒店的晚茶。我们走出酒店的时候，酒店的门卫还很热情地招呼我们，问我们要不要来一张合影，他引我们来到大堂中一水池前，很巧心思地拍了一张我们四人的合影和我们在水中的倒影。那个夜晚特别美好，我们知道那是因为好心好客又绅士风度的Mehran。<br><br>

	<hr><br>
马汉航空，夕发朝至，10个小时的飞行睡一觉就到了。飞机上大概80%以上是伊朗人，中国人很少，多数是去工作的，游客更少。<br><br>
<a href= "pic08.html">伊朗旅游地图</a><br><br>
 

 下飞机前，我取出头巾裹上，觉得很新奇，好像躲在头巾后，变成了另一个人。旁边一刚认识的中国哥们说，“嗯，这头巾不错。”伊朗目前有整肃着装的法律规定，街上有风纪警察，违反着装规定轻则罚款，重则坐牢。女性的着装要求：必须裹头巾，上衣下摆要盖过臀部，长袖长裤，不能露出手臂和腿。这对于五月底六月初三十几度的高温而言，好像有些过于严酷，且让我当一回伊斯兰妇女，体验其中真味。男人的着装基本没有特别要求，只要不是奇装异服，有失体统就够了。继土耳其之行后，再一次体会到伊斯兰世界里的男女不平等。<br><br>

 

 出关检查护照的时候，我微笑着和那位官员打招呼，可他看起来凶凶的，倒让我想起了《逃离德黑兰》里的镜头。后来，我慢慢发现中东一带的人，浓眉大眼，鼻高目深，如果表情严肃，很容易显得有点凶。在之后的旅行中，其实我接触到的伊朗人都是很友善的。<br><br>

 

 机场出关的人数并不算多，比浦东机场少多了，可领行李出门的速度却很慢，原因是所有行李出门前都要再经过一次安检。看起来外界对伊朗戒心重重，伊朗对外界也是呢。在漫长的等待队列中，我急切地找手机信号，想给家里报个平安。在反复开机关机几次后，终于信号出现了，可是怎么也拨不出去。已经下飞机一个多小时了，还是无法打通，但我知道我家先生正等着我电话呢，正着急，他的电话打进来了，听声音也着急了。我赶紧报了平安，因为在安检，就匆匆挂了，告诉他明天会打给他。挂了后才想起来，哎哟，要是我拨不出去，但他打得进来，我应该叫他打给我而不是叫他等，可现在没机会说了。想了想给他发了条短信，没有回复，又发了条，还是没回复。后来才知道，我的短信他倒是都收到了，可他的回复我没收到。唉，这伊朗的通信啊。。。后来我发现网络更是严格限制的，除了酒店大堂外，几乎找不到网络。好处就是干脆断了念头，整整10天没有任何工作的邮件或电话来打扰。坏处是我们家先生常常一天打10多次电话才能跟我通上一次话，有一次电话还串线串到一个外国的男人那里，把我先生吓了一大跳，以为我落到绑架者手中了。<br><br>

 

 出了关，德黑兰的早晨就迎面而来了。这个城市在巴列维时期（伊朗的最后一个王朝）被称为中东巴黎，当时的繁华可见一斑。伊斯兰革命后开始闭关锁国，因此目前的街景倒更像上海的80-90年代。不太一样的是，上海的80-90年代，街上到处是自行车，但德黑兰地势相当高，丘陵环绕，骑车会很吃力，因此这里多的是摩托和汽车。现在常驻人口1000万，流动人口1200万，由于多机车，空气污染的状况和高峰时段堵车的情况都和现在的上海很接近。整治交通拥堵的方法和北京一样--限行。不同的是，在这里如果空气污染指数超过一定标准，政府会给民众放假。北京人民如果听说了，一定很羡慕吧。<br><br>

德黑兰和上海一样，目前在本国举足轻重，但是个比较年轻的城市。萨法维王朝时期，这里只是国王进行朝拜的别院，卡加王朝时期才开始成为都城，所以这里的景点基本都在这两三百年的历史阶段。<br><br>

 

 此行的第一天和最后一天都是在德黑兰度过的。一头一尾两天各去了一座王宫和一座博物馆。第一天去的是格列斯坦宫（GolestanPalace），“Gole”是花的意思，因此格列斯坦皇宫意为花之皇宫。这座皇宫从卡加王朝到巴列维王朝由皇室居住。这是一个集华丽的宫殿，宁静的水池和优美的花园为一体的宫殿。后来又看了若干个不同时期的皇宫，基本都由这三个元素组成。有一种说法，说在波斯人的心目中，有水，有花园，有庭院的地方就是天堂了。<br><br>



  首先映入眼帘的是一个长长的水池，一溜儿喷泉，两旁鲜花绿树掩映，那干热的天气也变得令人愉快了。水池尽头就是一座宫殿。与中国的王宫不同，它是开放式的，在水池的另一头就能远远看到王宫中的宝座。这是一座类似汉白玉雕刻的宝座，两侧各由3位服饰不同的女子驮着宝座。据说这表示波斯帝国疆土开阔，统辖着各族人民。令人不解的是，这样沉重的宝座为什么要让女人来驮？宝座的台阶下蹲着2只狮子。与中国相同，在这里狮子象征权威，不同的是这两头狮子与中国建筑门口的石狮相比只能算是大猫。“大猫”两旁各有个精灵模样的人站立两厢。<br><br>





  这座宫殿无论是外表还是内饰都很华丽，最令人印象深刻的是彩釉瓷砖马赛克的外墙，内部晶莹闪烁的镜面镶嵌装饰和精细的石膏雕花。卡加王朝开始的装饰风格主要就是这三个元素，马赛克，镜面和石膏，其实都是比较经济的材料，但很考工艺，效果也是富丽堂皇。据说主要是因为到了卡加王朝，已进入半殖民地半封建时期，北面被俄国人控制，南面被英国人控制，波斯帝国日渐式微，而国君却一味只顾自己享乐。特别是卡加第四任国王纳赛尔丁，他很亲西方，喜欢西方的艺术。这座宫殿就有不少欧式风格：比如一般的波斯瓷砖或马赛克装饰的花纹以几何图形和花草为主要图案，可这座宫殿外墙上的瓷砖却常常可以看到西方的油画。波斯的颜色以蓝色为主，而这座宫殿外墙颜色非常艳丽，据说也是由于国王的品味开始偏西方所致。<br><br>







  纳赛尔丁不顾国家受西方列强的侵蚀，个人生活极其奢华，甚至多次举债游历欧洲，致使国库更加空虚。他在位近50年，最终遭刺杀身亡。遇刺时，太子不在京中，密不发丧，在此期间为掩人耳目，他的尸体被绑在一张椅子上坐在马车里游街，以安定民心，让大家以为国王还活着，直到太子赶回京中继承王位。现在格列斯坦宫内还陈列着那把绑过这位国君尸体的椅子，上面还能看到当时留下的淡淡血迹。除此之外，还有一副纳赛尔丁的汉白玉石棺，石棺上是他的雕像，雕刻精美。还有一幅油画，据说是纳赛尔丁带着他的宫廷画师共同游历欧洲，在那里学会了油画技法，回来画了一幅纳赛尔丁坐在格列斯坦宫明镜殿。从画上看，这座殿堂非常高大恢宏。可参观实物的时候却很惊讶的发现明镜殿其实只是间小屋子。经解说才知道，那位宫廷画师缩小了国王的比例而造成了一种视觉上的反差，来夸大了明镜殿的视觉效果。格列斯坦宫几乎处处都有这位君王的影子，可是站在一百多年后一个游客的角度，我所赞叹欣赏的都是当时铸造这些的波斯建筑师，画师及工匠的高度审美和手工艺，对这位君王却只是怀着一种淡淡的怜悯，可怜他就这样断送了大好江山。<br><br>



  用镜面镶嵌作房间内饰是我第一次看到，视觉冲击强烈，印象非常深刻。现在的王宫空无一人，进去参观，看着满眼亮晶晶的，觉得很闪很漂亮。可是想象一下，觉得生活在其中，抬头，转身，时不时看到自己一个或多个影子，应该会不舒服不自在的吧。这可能是我一个中国人的角度。另外，中国传统的审美观讲究一种单素无华却意境深远的美，和波斯人在这里体现的色彩绚烂，晶光四射有很大差别。不过这一点，我倒觉得浓淡皆宜，各有各的美。<br><br>







  这座宫殿有大理石殿、明镜殿、沙拉姆殿、钻石宫、通风楼等建筑，很值得慢慢逛，细细赏。最后可以走出来，坐在一片树荫下，欣赏它的园艺。这座宫殿处处有水池，有草坪，花园，浓荫，静静地望着，很是心旷神怡。可能是日照强烈的缘故，植物花卉都显得特别艳丽茁壮，欣欣然地怒放生长着。伊朗的天气非常干热，当天有三十七，八度，但在格列斯坦宫中穿着长袖长裤，裹着头巾的我并没有想象中的汗流浃背，狼狈不堪。原来在干热的天气下，人很少会出汗，只是觉得阳光非常的热辣。可是只要有一片树荫，微风一吹，立即觉得清凉。此时我也慢慢体会了这里的着装要求除了风纪的考虑，其实也有一定的现实意义。在这种气候下，其实最需要抵御的是阳光，而不是散热排汗。所以长袖长裤，头巾，其实还蛮适合的。不过我并不喜欢头巾，倒不是因为热，而是很不自由，它不断滑落，被吹落，令我不能心无挂碍，很是可恶。不过过后几天，我慢慢琢磨出了一点心得：1. 尽量用棉纱面料的头巾，不容易滑落；2. 尽量把辫子梳成一个高高的马尾，可以从头顶顶住头巾（从当地女孩那里学来的）；3. 可以用一个小小的别针别住头巾在脖子这里的接口，但尽量避免别在头发上，不然不好看。<br><br>

 

  



心满意足地踱出格列斯坦宫，我们去了地毯博物馆。这座博物馆是巴列维王朝最后一位王后法拉赫巴列维所建，这位王后是一位艺术爱好者，之后我们还常常会提到她的名字。这座博物馆的外观据说是仿造织地毯机的样式而建，内部展示着16-20世o5000余件手织地毯。两年前在土耳其见识了也是世界闻名的土耳其地毯，但看了伊朗的波斯地毯后，觉得那是小巫见大巫了。<br><br>



  在博物馆的入口处，展示了地毯的各种天然染色原料及织地毯的各种工具。波斯地毯在原料的选择，色泽调配、图案设计和编织技巧都有严格的要求。一块好的地毯大致取决于它的设计，色彩（都取自天然动植物），用料（丝，羊毛，棉，以丝为最佳），密实度。它大致分为城市风格和游牧风格两种。据说城市风格地毯是事先设计图样，以人物，故事为主题居多，伊斯法罕的地毯为此风格代表。游牧风格则事先不设计，边想边织。<br><br>

 

  波斯地毯很喜欢以花卉植物为题材，因为伊朗以戈壁居多，花园对波斯人来说是幸福生活的象征。踩着花卉图案的地毯就好像踩在花园里一般。还有一种柏树叶的图案，也是随处可见。据说这里的年轻人结婚时，如果父母有经济条件，就会挑选上好的波斯地毯，作为结婚礼物。一来实用，二来可以代代相传。我觉得这种家庭观念其实和中国人的很接近。<br><br>

 

  地毯博物馆的藏品很丰富，每一件都是精品，细细欣赏观看，真是美不胜收。有一棵世界名人树，在一棵树上绣了古今中外的世界名人，构思独特；有指着麦加方向的祈祷地毯；有双面绣毯；有生机勃勃的生命树；历史故事；太阳，星辰，十二生肖等等。我最喜欢的一件名叫《四季》：中间是波斯波利斯的雕刻和琐罗亚斯德教的智慧老人，四周是春夏秋冬世俗生活的景象，四角还缀着神话故事，如亚当夏娃（亚当夏娃的故事是拜火教，伊斯兰教，基督教和犹太教等各教派中共有的故事）。我觉得这件的设计特别体现波斯文化特色，在后来的旅行中，我的体会就是很多伊朗人都认为自己是波斯人，他们为如波斯波利斯这样的古文明骄傲，虽然现在是伊斯兰政教合一的国家，但人民并不是那么的伊斯兰，而是更看重一种智慧和优雅的内心世界。很多人不敢说自己不是穆斯林，可又从内心深处并不融入穆斯林世界，很多人还是崇尚古老的琐罗亚斯德教义，同时过着波斯风格的俗事生活。这幅地毯就很好地概括了这些，我觉得我也可以给它起名叫《我的伊朗印象》。<br><br>



  走出地毯博物馆，还是一派烈日炎炎，我们驱车去看一看德黑兰的地标建筑自由纪念塔。这座塔完成于1971年10月，巴列维王朝时期为纪念伊朗帝国成立2500周年举行了盛大的庆典，此塔为此而建。塔高45米，塔基长63米，宽42米，采用钢筋水泥和大理石建成，气派雄伟，风格现代，中国人俗称它为“大裤衩”。我好像记得苏州金鸡湖畔也有个建筑叫类似“裤衩”的名字，可气派，风格与此相差甚远。塔建在一个开阔的平台上，走上平台，就有一群大概十四五岁的孩子（或者可能更小，伊朗人外貌看起来偏大）跑来要求跟我合影。真是一群快乐爽朗的孩子，兴奋地摆了各种神气的姿势来跟我拍照，火热骄阳下我有一点点蔫耷耷的心情马上在他们的影响下清朗起来。合过影，听到一阵乐声，循声望去，是一群帅哥在唱歌。伊朗的男人有型的很多，从调子听起来像是一支进行曲。我们在一旁看热闹，好一会儿才明白是在拍电视或电影。到现在我一想起自由纪念塔，脑海里还是那支激情澎湃的曲子。<br><br>



  那一天以一个波斯风格的下午茶结尾。脱了鞋，对面靠坐在一只绣着柏树叶图案的方塌上，舒服极了。茶和茶点放在中间或案前。细看四周，墙上有一溜瓷砖做的波斯小女孩，细密画风的画，银丝镶嵌画，玻璃球花灯，长长的窗帘穗子，优美而安闲。波斯人是很爱喝茶的，就是一般的红茶，特别的是糖一般不是直接加在茶里，而是含一薄片在嘴里，就着茶慢慢喝。一天的劳顿和暑气顿时消散了。<br><br>



  晚间我们坐国内航空飞往亚兹德，对这座古城，我有好多期待。开篇就是好的，我们住进了一家波斯花园风味的酒店（MOSHIR GARDEN），这是此行我最喜欢的一家酒店，优雅精致，浓浓的波斯风情。我住在顶楼，房间外有个很大的露台。夜浓了，暑气慢慢退下，一轮明月高挂在天边。我突然想起看过的一本小说《德黑兰的屋顶》，故事中的小男孩经常喜欢和最要好的朋友在屋顶彻夜谈心，从自家屋顶偷看邻居家他暗恋的女孩。在这静静的夜里，Moshir Garden的屋顶，我突然很能体会那小说中的情景。<br><br>

	<b><a name="T21">设拉子</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	<a href= "pic08.html">伊朗旅游地图</a><br><br>
 设拉子是此行我最爱的地方。其实也没有什么奇景，只是这座城市的氛围让我觉得很舒服。它是古波斯的中心，玫瑰和夜莺之城，哈菲兹的故乡。此次伊朗之行中，风气最开放的城市。与亚兹德很不同，这里对着装的要求很松，裤腿，衣袖短点，头巾被风吹掉了，都不会有人管。在这里街上经常有人主动和我们微笑打招呼，他们的表情是轻松而善意的。这里的年轻人也比较自由时髦，因此看起来更活泼快乐。这里照例可以看到一大家子人席地而坐喝茶聊天，看到我们走过，会热情地邀请我们一同喝茶。我可以大胆地请他们一起拍照，逗他们的孩子玩，一般也都会受到很善意的欢迎。总之这里的人给人感觉热情愉快，斯文有礼。<br><br>

 

 我印象最深刻的是哈菲兹陵墓。哈菲兹是伊朗最伟大的诗人之一，生于14世纪，与中国的元代同时期，因此也被中国人称为伊朗的汤显祖，被欧洲人称为伊朗的歌德。他长于抒情诗，劝诫诗，颂诗和鲁拜诗。这些诗歌珍品在艺术和内容上都堪称是波斯诗歌的巅峰之作。他的诗歌不涉及宗教，政治，没有歧视，通俗，押韵，最后往往会以一句有哲理的话结尾。Iradj说哈菲兹的诗歌是伊朗人民心灵的明灯。<br><br>

一般古代文人的陵墓在我印象中都是一派凄清的景象，可哈菲兹的陵墓却是人流如织，繁花似锦。伊朗的旅游景点一般人都很少，这可能是我看到人最多的一个景点了，而且里面主要都是伊朗当地人。他们或安静地手抚哈菲兹的汉白玉石棺慢慢走过；或三俩知己，一大家子席地而坐，侃侃而谈；或漫步在一旁的小花园，在那里葬着好些哈菲兹的崇拜者；或席地而坐独自沉思；或手捧诗书轻轻吟颂。园子里鲜花盛开，文气流动。我很受感动，一个爱诗的民族，无论经济强弱，由谁统治，都应该是充满希望，前途光明的吧。<br><br>





 在墓园的入口处，有个人手拿一个小盒子，上面蹲一只小鸟。领队小徐解释说，哈菲兹的诗常常被伊朗人用来占卜。我突然想起来在小说中曾经读到过，于是很感兴趣地要试一试。那占卜的人便放出小鸟，让它从盒子里叼出一张粉色的纸，上面就有一首哈菲兹的诗。我让Iradj帮我解释，Iradj说这首诗是说你很快会和你所爱的人相聚。我微微一笑说，那是自然，结束这次旅行我就会回家和我家先生女儿团聚。Iradj很江湖的说，你看，所以说算得很准哦。<br><br>

 

 出了哈菲兹墓园走出不远，就是古兰经门。这个城门是早在一千年前，建于设拉子城北的一座装饰用的城门。卡里穆汗曾在这个城门顶上的小房间里放置了一本《古兰经》，以求赐福。在这部《古兰经》的影响下，这个城门将保佑设拉子人均能平安归来。在这里附近还埋了另一位诗人哈鸠，他也是哈菲兹的崇拜者。<br><br>





 我们到古兰经门下时，已是黄昏，人们结束了一天的工作和学习，纷纷聚到这里休闲。有一群少年人，在高高的墙壁上飞檐走壁，还看到一些孩子，开心地追逐，嬉戏，买气球，买糖。好些家庭席地喝茶。有一户人家看到我在看他们，立即招手唤我。我走近，那里唯一的男人（一位老者）立即站起身给我腾出个位置让我坐下。最年长的女人倒了茶招待我。他们家的人不会说英语，只会问QingNing?(这是我用拼音注的音调)。当时我已经学会，知道伊朗人把中国人称为“QingNing”。也不知道是秦人还是清人，我个人觉得大概是秦人。我忙答是，他们就很高兴，竖起大拇指。伊朗人对中国人是很友好的，这个在我们整个旅程中处处可以感受到。<br><br>

 



 莫克清真寺（俗称粉红清真寺）最近在中国游客中被摄影爱好者们炒热了，成为中国游客去伊朗必去的地方。实在是因为那奇幻的光线，充满了浪漫色彩。听了Iradj的讲解，我感觉伊朗人可能并不那么看重这座清真寺。据说它建于19世纪的卡加王朝，当时有一场很严重的地震，很多清真寺被毁。这座清真寺在匆忙中建起来，所以相当潦草，连穹顶都没有建，宣礼塔也是很小的两座。另外，Iradj说卡加王朝开始亲西方，而偏离波斯传统。波斯的颜色是蓝色，这座清真寺一反常态地用了很多粉红色，根据波斯人传统的审美观，粉红是一只俗艳的颜色，一般不登大雅之堂。他好像对这粉红的清真寺颇不以为然。倒是特别指给我们几处让我们留意的地方：1。清真寺外墙常常会夹着一块木块，是用来防震的。2。宣礼塔很矮，与主建筑相连，是波斯建筑师想体现琐罗亚斯德教的t望塔和灯塔。3。花瓶模样的花样其实是体现琐罗亚斯德教的火，这座清真寺也有个水池，再加上这些火样的花样，也就“四行”俱全了。我知道Iradj“波斯文化沙文主义”又来了，其实中国人也很容易有同样的问题。这是一种文化优越感，不能算好，但却是根深蒂固，很容易不经意流露。<br><br>

 



 

 站在我一个中国人的角度，这座清真寺是很美的。首先它的粉红色并不俗艳，和波斯的蓝色和马赛克装饰配合在一起，无论是在蓝天下，还是倒映在水池里，都很漂亮。最绝的是它分冬礼拜室和夏礼拜室两间。夏礼拜室光线暗一点，用蓝色和乳黄色的马赛克，垂下铜质吊灯，凉爽又清雅。冬礼拜室阳光充足，奇妙的是阳光透过彩花玻璃会投射出五彩的光线在整个礼拜室中，配上粉红色的柱子和地下大红的地毯，气氛极其梦幻。我们一行人到了这间礼拜室都为这些五彩的光线兴奋异常，在这里随手拍一张照片都是很美的。听说有摄影爱好者会来了又来，在此流连忘返。我很想跟Iradj说，其实不管是不是波斯风格的，他们伊朗人是很有审美情趣的。既然在历史长河中经历了那么多的混杂，那么多的交流和取予，不如就放下吧，只简单的接受美就好了。不过我没说，我发现Iradj很敏感的。<br><br>

 去世界各地，我都爱逛花园，这波斯的花园风味独特，我们拜访了两座。一座叫做伊尔姆花园，这是18世纪赞德王朝时期一位有钱人的私宅。那位伊朗最后的王后法拉赫巴列维后来买下了它作为设拉子大学的植物园。照例，水池，喷泉，彩釉瓷砖，柏树，玫瑰是波斯花园不可或缺的。<br><br>



 

 但是我要说的是，我最喜欢的部分是这座园子的气氛。那天我们有充足的时间四处闲逛，我看到的无非是两类人：和和美美的家庭，和甜甜蜜蜜的恋人。时下的伊朗，公开谈恋爱也是被禁止的。很有些像中国古代的“男女授受不亲”，公共汽车是男女分前后车厢分开乘坐的，连婚礼都是男女宾分开的。这是我在伊朗唯一看到一个城市，有那么多出双入对的人出现在公共场合。其实爱情在哪里都是一样的，那种甜蜜，那种心心相印的感觉，就是一个旅人从旁一瞥，也能心领神会。<br><br>



 另外，就是那些家庭和孩子们。我觉得伊朗人和中国人很像，是家庭观念很重的民族。公园里处处可见祖孙三代一大家子一起游园。我们团里的一位叔叔给一个家庭拍了很好看的照片，他想要问他们要地址或邮箱好日后把照片发给他们。他找来我跟他们表达这一意图，无奈这家人家听不懂英语，我们比划了半天也无法让他们了解。最后，我们遗憾地互望着，这家人家的女主人突然用很生的英语说，“Iranisgood.WeloveIran.”我马上说，“That’sright.Weloveittoo.”她大概听懂了，露出很灿烂的笑容，回头讲给她的家人听，她的家人也露出很开心的笑容。什么叫爱国心呢，这就是爱国心吧。现在的伊朗闭关锁国，又受到整个西方社会的制裁，很少有外国人来。外部世界对伊朗的认识多数也是来源于西方媒体。他们应该也是知道这一点，所以急于向我们这样的异乡人表达吧。<br><br>

 

 又有一家人也很有趣。两个男人穿着白色的长袍，带着四个孩子在花丛中拍照。那些孩子，各个可爱，我看了心好痒，躲在一边偷拍。那个男人看见了我，马上招手叫我。我马上上前解释，不是想打搅他们，而是他们的孩子好漂亮可爱。他对我点点头，把他的三个孩子齐崭崭地抱到花丛中让我拍个够。我没想到他这样善意，于是又给他和他的孩子拍了合影。给他一旁的亲戚和孩子也拍了照片。他们都很高兴地做我的模特。谁说伊朗人是恐怖分子呢？之后，我把这组照片给Iradj看，问他这种白色的长袍是不是他们的民族服装，他马上很嫌弃地把我的相机推得很远说，“不对，这是阿拉伯人。”呵呵，起码在Iradj心中，他真的很不喜欢阿拉伯人呢。<br><br>





 还去了一处叫作橘子园的花园，也是十八世纪一位官员的私宅。园子里种了很多椰枣，桑树和橘子树（其实是一种桔与柠檬杂交的植物）。这个园子糅合了很多的波斯元素，首先是典型的花园，水池，庭园的结构。其次，这座宅子的主人好像想把波斯建筑中最美的部分都集合在他的大宅中：仿波斯波利斯万国晋见的浮雕，彩釉瓷砖（十八世纪波斯美男子，狮子与牛的咬春图，太阳神的光明崇拜），镜面装饰，石膏浮雕，彩花玻璃，细密画。看起来这位官员是很有钱的，不知是一位好官还是贪官，但无论如何，这座园子留给后人很多美的享受。<br><br>











 设拉子的空气是伊朗最轻松自由的，在这种气氛感染下，Iradj告诉我们现在在这个国家，什么都禁止，但什么都有。他们会拉起窗帘，在家喝自酿的酒，跳舞开party。饮酒，歌舞都是被禁止的。有一天，司机Mehran在车里放很热情奔放的波斯音乐，他的手指在方向盘上打节奏。Iradj叫我们拉好窗帘，然后给我们唱了支波斯情歌，还解释给我们听歌词的内容，波斯人的爱情其实和中国人的有点像，是一种很含蓄深沉的浪漫。随后他和着波斯音乐翩翩起舞。跳到一半，司机说，“我忍不住了，我也要跳”，然后居然就马上在路边停下了我们的大巴，加入热舞的行列。他们俩跳着热力四射的舞蹈，可爱极了。说起这两位，司机是农业工程师，Iradj是文学博士。目前都是经济所迫，操起这一行，才能更好地养家糊口。令我很感动的是，即便如此，他们俩每天在我们面前表现的都是礼貌，知性又愉快的知识分子形象。<br><br>

 

 今日的伊朗，在1978-1979年伊斯兰革命后，政教合一，闭关锁国，受到西方的经济制裁，又经过8年两伊战争的浩劫，经济一落千丈。人们在精神层面也受到种种压制和禁锢，一切以伊斯兰的教义为准绳。但是人们对文化，文明的追求呢？波斯人一贯在强权之下也要在文化上同化对方的那颗心呢？起码在Iradj的身上，我看到了这种强烈的要求和不懈的努力。他的导游讲解不断地在文化层面向我们灌输波斯的文化思想。<br><br>

 

 无论是看伊朗电影，还是看伊朗人写的书，还是来到伊朗和当地的人接触，我都能感受到一种自尊心和道德上的自我约束。现在伊朗人的日子其实很不好过，但街上几乎看不到乞丐。遇到的都是微笑，彬彬有礼的人。他们多数自得其乐地生活，大树下，桥洞里，只要有一片荫凉，就铺开一块地毯，和家人朋友喝喝茶，愉快地聊天。那茶点茶具通常都非常简单普通，但那种自得其乐，友爱亲情却是随处可见的。他们热情地对待外来的客人，可并不讨要什么回报。我一次也没有遇到在有些贫穷国家会遇到的纠缠，诈骗游客的事。可我却经常遇到他们热情地请我们喝茶，与我们合影聊天。没有什么目的的，只是表达对远道而来的中国客人的友好。当然我在伊朗只有短短10天，接触到的人和事也很有限，但伊朗给我留下的印象是贫贱不能移的。我常常想到《我在伊朗长大》里读到的一句话：“保有自己的尊严，诚实地对待自己。”<br><br>

 

 Iradj还告诉我们在波斯有个传统，富有的人死后会将财产捐给各种慈善基金，如发展教育，医疗或帮助穷人。但伊斯兰革命后，由阿訇掌管所有捐款的用处，阿訇中饱私囊，捐的人显著变少了。Iradj说历史上在萨珊王朝，有过很类似的情况。萨珊王朝原本非常强大，可是也出现了严重的宗教僧侣腐败，引起人民强烈不满。因此7世纪，阿拉伯人打来时，波斯人由于对当局统治者很失望，就放弃了抵抗，献城给阿拉伯人，高度发展的波斯才会被文化尚未开化的阿拉伯人攻陷。等波斯人发现阿拉伯人对人民更残暴掠夺时，为时已晚。我想Iradj他们可能对目前由宗教人士控制的国家也有很多的不满吧，他不便直接发牢骚，只能借古讽今了。<br><br>

	<b><a name="T22">波斯波利斯</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
 波斯波利斯其实是希腊语，因此伊朗当地人听我们说“波斯波利斯”常常没有反应，其实这大概是伊朗人最引以为豪的历史古迹了。在帕萨尔加德我们曾经说过，波斯帝国的大流士一世迁都到此。大流士一世时的波斯，是当时世界上最强大的国家，域横跨亚、非、欧三洲，中亚草原的大部分、印度西北部、埃及和北非、小亚细亚和巴尔干半岛的色雷斯地区，都在其版图之内。当时印度小国林立，中国还在春秋末叶，欧洲除了希腊之外，其余地区还没有出现国家形态。中国人其实是有大国情结的，我们常常缅怀唐朝时的盛世景象。伊朗人也一样，只是他们的盛世出现得更早。<br><br>

 

 波斯波利斯从大流士大帝开始修建，历经几代君王，每个君王都修建了自己的宫殿，最终在马其顿的亚历山大的铁蹄下和阿契美尼德王朝一起灭亡，是一座未完工的都城。这里是古波斯的礼仪之都，是在波斯历新年的时候，诸侯国带着贡品觐见帝王的地方。波斯波利斯的入口有110级台阶，象征着当时有二十多个诸侯国前来觐见，最远的需要经过110个驿站才能到达。<br><br>



 波斯波利斯最有看头的就是石雕和柱子。进门处，有两座神兽浮雕石像，这两座神兽有人面（代表智慧），牛身（代表力量）和双翼（代表自由）。2500年前的波斯人已经清楚地意识到这三样对人类幸福的重要了。有表现国王和狮子搏斗的雕刻；有国王坐在宝座上，后有人打着伞盖的雕刻，这个看起来很眼熟，中国古代的君王也是这样的。但Iradj很得意地夸耀，看看伞是来源于哪个国家？我想起来兵马俑里也有坐着战车，打着伞盖的，但算算日子，在300年后，于是也只好承认大概伞是波斯人先有的。有好些浮雕雕着一头狮子咬住一头牛的尾部，原来在波斯，狮子代表春天，牛代表冬天。这是一幅咬春图，预示着冬去春来。这波斯波利斯的万国觐见正是在波斯历的新年（中国春分时节），所以咬春图非常的应景呢。最多的就是表现不同地域民族的诸侯国前来纳贡觐见的浮雕。每个使臣都由一个波斯人引领着，后面跟着他的随从，手捧贡品，那些使臣和礼物各具特色，惟妙惟肖。据说在所有诸侯国中，米底人最尊贵亲善，因为居鲁士的母亲来自米底。波斯人穿裙，米底人穿裤。枪放在脚面上，昂扬地前行。有些雕像中的波斯人和使节是面对面的，他们一手搭在对方的肩膀上，一手相握，很友好愉快地互望着。所有的浮雕中的人表情都是平静而愉快的。这让人在感叹古波斯帝国强大的同时，也感叹它作为大国的那种世界大同的气概和胸怀。我不禁想起唐朝诗人王维的一句诗：“万国衣冠拜冕旒”。只是唐朝迎来这样的大国景象已是一千多年以后了。<br><br>













 那些柱子很高，从十几米到二十米不等，由榫头连接，柱顶上有成对的石雕动物傲视寰宇。这些石雕动物以凤，马和牛为主。伊朗的凤和中国的很不同，看起来类马类鸟，如今伊朗航空的标志就是这样的凤头。这些石兽都很大，是在地面上雕刻成后再架到柱顶上的。<br><br>



 波斯波利斯不仅仅是每年接见诸侯国来朝的地方，还囤积了古波斯帝国巨额的财富。据说亚历山大在洗劫波斯波利斯的时候，用了一万头骡子和五千匹骆驼才将所有的财宝运走。据Iradj说有考古学家在这里挖出2块金块和2块银块，上面记载着波斯波利斯的历史，现藏于博物馆。其中一块金块在战争中被盗。根据记载，波斯波利斯的建造没有使用奴隶，只是用了工人。所有的工人都有工资，女工还有带薪产假。如果这历史属实，那伊朗人还真应该感到骄傲，这表明他们确实是很早就文明开化了。<br><br>

 

 在波斯波利斯的附近，还有一处帝王谷，埋葬着阿契美尼德王朝从大流士大帝开始的多位君王。由于古波斯帝国奉琐罗亚斯德教为国教，因此君王们也是以天葬的方式埋葬的。他们的墓就在山岩上，上层类似波斯波利斯的万国觐见浮雕是阿契美尼德王朝所刻，已经颇有些模糊。下层的浮雕都是萨珊王朝所刻，大多描绘着萨珊王朝与罗马人作战的场面，雕刻明显更精细生动。有表现骁勇征战的场面，有表现君权神授的场面，其中有一幅很有意思，它有一排人物，最右面那个看起来和别的明显不同。原来这里本来是一幅萨珊王朝前1500年闪米特人雕的浮雕，后来在萨珊王朝被覆盖，重新雕刻。有趣的是，雕刻的人故意留下了最右面那个，是为表达对先人的一份敬意吗？<br><br>







 

 在陵墓的对面有个塔形建筑，经导游讲解才知道，这小小一座塔，原来有很多的功用：1。收藏琐罗亚斯德教的经典；2。保留火种；3。处理天葬的尸体；4。建筑表面有方孔，是古代的钟表，可根据太阳照到哪个方孔来判断时间。<br><br>



 那天的波斯波利斯和帝王谷酷热难当，除了遗迹，岩壁和黄沙，只有很少数沙漠植物。历史上无论出现过怎样的繁荣和强大，最终真正会留在人类文明进程里的不是权力也不是金钱，唯有真，善，美。这是那一天看了那么多古迹后，我唯一的感想。<br><br>

	<b><a name="T23">走访伊朗民间</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
最后一天我们在德黑兰渡过，还有赫赫有名的珠宝博物馆及伊朗最后一位国王最后十年居住的尼亚瓦朗宫。<br><br>

 

 珠宝博物馆是伊朗中央银行的地下珍宝保险库，收藏了几个世纪以来伊朗王室最珍贵的国宝，其中最突出的包括卡加王朝和巴列维王朝的四顶王冠；61厘米高，37公斤重的纯金地球仪，上面镶嵌着四万多颗红、绿宝石，钻石，用以标出各国位置；萨法维王朝时期从印度抢来的镶满珠宝的“孔雀宝座”；还有一颗重达182克拉的粉钻“光明之海”。两年前去土耳其，在托普卡帕皇宫也看过一个珠宝博物馆，当时从没在别处看过那么些大颗的钻石和红绿宝石，很是赞叹。这次在伊朗的珠宝博物馆，看到更多更华贵的珠宝，感觉倒没有那么强烈了。比土耳其好的是在伊朗珠宝博物馆内有专门的英语讲解员，知识丰富，讲解很有趣。比如说到那座地球仪，他说，地球仪上除了伊朗和英国是用钻石镶嵌的(当时伊朗国王与英国女王交好)，其他国家用的都是红绿宝石。中国是用红宝石镶嵌的。那是因为建造地球仪的时候，国王认为世界上最珍贵的宝石是钻石，可是如今世界上公认最珍贵的是红宝石，就像今日的中国，国际地位日益强盛。还比如他引导我们看一些咖啡壶，水壶，王冠等卡加王朝第二任国王的用具时说，你们看，这些用具尺寸都特别大一点，那是因为那一位国王个子特别矮小，所以他就特别喜欢用大的东西来显得自己比较高大。他说那话的时候表情并没有什么不同，可我明显觉得他的言外之意是：物质是无法使人变得伟大的，多年以后，这些东西只让人特别记住了这位国王的矮小。还有那四顶王冠也让我想到类似的问题，四顶王冠无一例外价值连城，可只有法拉赫王后的那顶后冠除了珠光宝气外还设计精巧优美。我当时的感受就是伊朗王朝最后几代真是穷奢极侈啊，怪不得很快亡国了，只有这最后的王后总算还有些品味。据Iradj说，这些王室珠宝在巴列维时期已经在博物馆归国家所有，巴列维王室逃亡的时候也未带走一件。在Iradj眼中，巴列维是个好国王。<br><br>

 

 珠宝博物馆严禁拍照，因此下面是网上下载下来的图片，供各位观赏，聊胜于无：<br><br>



 



 尼亚瓦朗宫据说是卡加王朝时期为躲避当时城市中的一场瘟疫而选址在德黑兰建造的，目前它所在的位置是德黑兰的富人区。尼亚瓦朗宫的外表非常朴素，可是内部用彩花玻璃，镜面，油画，细密画，水晶灯装饰的宫殿却很华丽。由于它是巴列维王朝最后10年居住的地方，所以也是我们此行参观过的最现代的一座王宫，内部的房间功能和家具都很现代。还有好些很有历史价值的照片，比如其中一幅照片是卡加王朝第四任国王，那位著名的纳赛尔丁，亲自拍摄的。他有一天无意中看到仆人们偷懒，横七竖八地倒在地下睡觉，就拍下了他们的睡态，当作证据来惩罚他们。还有当时卡加和巴列维王朝的国王与各国元首交换的照片，比如毛泽东的照片就在其中。在国王的办公室，看到一座小王子的石膏头像。想想真辛酸，这位王子，当初很可能也是国王寄予厚望的孩子吧，没想到就这样成了个末代流亡的王子，长期逃亡在美国。<br><br>







 

 那天在尼亚瓦朗宫的门口，有一对双胞胎小姐妹久等小徐多时。原来去年她们去杭州玩，小徐是她们的导游，成了好朋友。她们姐儿俩听说小徐在德黑兰，特意带了礼物在此等候。她们带来的礼物是一只印了一张三人在杭州合影的马克杯。看她们很亲热地围在小徐周围，说这问那，我觉得好温暖。伊朗人给我的印象真的也是很重感情的民族。后来，小徐告诉我两个女孩子说学校里的历史课本现在只有几页是关于伊斯兰革命前的。我的天啊，伊朗的历史有几千年，伊斯兰革命是1978-1979年开始的，历史书居然以革命后为主，这还叫什么历史课啊？看我眼睛瞪得那么大，小徐笑笑说，双胞胎姐妹告诉她，历史老师说这样的历史书不用学，老师上课另外交，考试帮忙同学们通过。双胞胎姐妹还说阿拉伯语目前是学校的必修课，但是她们很讨厌学，只是应付考试而已。英语学校有教，但比较浅，爸爸妈妈另外给她们请了补习。她们的爸爸妈妈都是医生。这两个女孩子英语不错，我便直接问她们中学毕业后想去哪里上大学？我本来以为她们不喜欢阿拉伯语，也不见得喜欢目前政教合一的政府，目前的伊朗女性还是有诸多的不自由，肯定会想要去国外念大学，比如美国常青藤之类的。没想到，两个女孩不假思索，异口同声地说：德黑兰大学。我追问一句：不想去美国读大学吗？她们的回答是如果功课不够好，考不取德黑兰大学，才会考虑去美国念书。这些话，让我觉得目前的伊朗虽然面临各种问题和困难，可是这个国家还是有希望的。为人师的明白应该教什么，祖国的未来也定位清楚地把未来定在本国国内。<br><br>



 去尼亚瓦朗宫的路上，我们路过美国驻伊朗大使馆的旧址，这里自从1979年劫持人质事件后关闭至今。门口的自由女神画像已经被涂抹成了魔鬼。我远远地站在马路对面拍了张照，看到对面有两个男人恶狠狠地看着我，吓得我立即走开了。<br><br>



 上车后，Iradj说对于劫持人质事件，伊朗人民也觉得这样的行为有欠考虑，他希望我们了解这是少数受政府煽动的年轻人幼稚的行为，不能代表伊朗人民的意愿。我心中对这件事一直有很多的疑问。从《逃离德黑兰》了解到的历史是巴列维国王被伊斯兰领袖霍梅尼推翻，逃亡国外，后去美国治疗癌症。伊朗民众要求引渡国王回国受审，遭到美国拒绝，因此愤怒之下冲进大使馆劫持了几十名使馆人员长达一年多。小徐解释说卡加王朝时期国家处于半殖民地半封建时期，北面被俄国人控制，南面被英法控制。巴列维王朝政变上台后，改变了治国的策略，他们的重点是富国强民。巴列维王朝一方面依靠西方发展经济，另一方面在1951年实现了石油国有化，抬高石油价格从而使经济飞速发展，伊朗一度成为世界第四大经济强国。这样一来，欧美的利益受到损害，于是支持霍梅尼发动二月革命夺取政权。霍梅尼政府原来是欧美扶持上台的，那他究竟为什么会鼓动人民仇恨美国呢？<br><br>

 

 我把这个问题提给了小徐，Iradj大概听到了，就问我在问什么？并且马上邀请我坐到他的身边，他要亲自讲给我听。Iradj的解释是霍梅尼和美国政府作为政客，只是在互相利用。夺取政权后的霍梅尼政府没能如西方所料成为另一个受制于西方的傀儡政府，而是把伊朗变成了一个政教合一的国家，彻底闭关锁国了。之后美国又鼓动伊拉克发动两伊战争，蛊惑说阿拉伯地区的伊斯兰世界会为伊朗所控制，所以要削弱伊朗。结果伊朗和伊拉克打了8年两败俱伤的战争，让美国渔翁得利了。美国还借口要遏制伊朗经济发展，来控制其在阿拉伯地区的势力，要求其它阿拉伯国家降低油价，其实是为美国自身谋利。说完这些，Iradj马上接着又说可是他并不因为这些而仇恨美国，因为一个政府保护自己的国家和人民利益，这件事本身在他看来并没有错。他说现在伊朗被西方经济制裁，因此只能大量的与中国做生意，可是不要以为中国政府就是好人，伊朗卖给中国的石油，中国从来不付钱。我惊讶地瞪大了眼睛说，“怎么会？怎么能不付钱的呢？”Iradj告诉我说原来中国会给伊朗一张采购货物单，伊朗从这个单子上选择从中国进口产品，用这些抵消中国买石油的价款。可是那张单子上的好些物品根本是伊朗也盛产而不需要进口的，可是因为要用这种方式来抵消货款，伊朗无奈也只能这么做。Iradj还特别加上一句：“可是别错会了我的意，我认为中国这样做为中国利益，也是无可厚非的。我只是想用这个例子表达，每个政府都应该为保护本国人民的利益而努力。”<br><br>

 

 听到这里，有个问题就自然产生了，我问他，“站在这个角度，伊朗人民究竟更喜欢巴列维王朝还是现在的政教合一的伊斯兰政权呢？”Iradj的观点是那肯定是巴列维王朝，他说巴列维时期国王所致力的就是复兴波斯帝国，富国强民，而且他某种程度的确实现了部分理想。为了说明这个观点，他跟我说了几件他的亲身经历。在他11岁那年，正是伊斯兰革命爆发前一年，他的父亲带他去了一次欧洲。他的父亲每年都会去德国买一辆豪车，然后回途中再去一下法国给他的母亲带些礼物。Iradj还特别指出说不是他们家特别豪阔，而是当时很多伊朗人都是如此，经济上非常富裕。他随父亲买了车后来到巴黎最贵的百货商店，当时是下午两三点，可店门却关了。询问之下，门卫说那座5层的百货大楼被伊朗人包场了。他们表明伊朗人的身份后也被很客气地请了进去，和已经在那里的大概25个伊朗人一同扫货。之后他们回到酒店，和事先约好的伊朗朋友共进晚餐。席间那位朋友说，当天一下飞机就去了一个很好的法国餐馆午餐。拿到账单才发现钱包丢了，于是向服务生解释，结果服务生叫来老板，老板很激动，当他吃霸王餐。可是他一说到自己是伊朗人，老板的态度立即改变了。和颜悦色地跟他道歉，并叫车送他回酒店。他很感动，向老板保证回到酒店就会设法付账给他，老板笑着说不用，伊朗的国王给法国政府发过正式的信函，信中说要照顾好去法国的伊朗子民，如果伊朗人在法国遇到任何困难要帮他们解决，账单直接寄到伊朗驻法国大使馆，由政府买单。我又一次听得目瞪口呆。<br><br>
 
 Iradj接着说，他和父亲开车回家，会经过土耳其。他父亲离开法国时买了一箱高级雪茄，可是父亲是不抽烟的，Iradj问这雪茄是买来干嘛的。结果到了土耳其境内，父亲让他摇下车窗，把雪茄沿路撒出去。因为当时土耳其还很贫穷，出于仇富心理，土耳其人常常会袭击驾着豪车经过的伊朗人，用雪茄可以避免他们那样做。Iradj不无痛心的叹了口气说，“可是现在连土耳其人也对我们趾高气扬了。”他接着说，后来伊朗革命爆发了，生活完全改变了，他的妹妹们被送去美国，父母亲留在伊朗，他也留下照顾。他成年后，有一年去迪拜公干。他无比鄙夷地说迪拜人除了钱什么都不剩了，是很肮脏的人。可是他过海关的时候，那位海关关员用两只手指拎着他的护照很鄙视地说，“伊朗人，那边去。”他虽然心里有些气，可也就听从去了指定的柜台。那个柜台前排了很长的队，而旁边那一队却很短。所以他就站了过去，很多伊朗人马上跟了过来。这时，刚才那位官员出现了，问是谁把那里的一道门打开，站到这条队伍里来的。在场的伊朗人都不敢作声，Iradj就回答说是他先站过来的，但当时这道门就是开着的，他也不知道不能站到这条队来。那位官员大声呵斥他，说他撒谎，说伊朗人全都是骗子。这下Iradj火了，坚持说，“我就是伊朗人，我从来不撒谎。”这时，又来了一位长官，说，“我们的海关官员不可能说谎的，你这样说话是什么意思？”后面的伊朗人都很害怕地劝他少说两句，被关进迪拜的监狱就糟糕了。Iradj回答说，没有撒谎就是没有撒谎，他们可以调监控录像，看看究竟是谁开了那道门。他宁愿死也不能承认没有做过的事。如果这样死了，他相信自己会去天堂的，说不定比在这里过这样屈辱的日子还好。他说到这里，跑来另一个海关官员，跟他说不要理那两个人，并且带他从另一个出口出去了。Iradj说，“我终于还是赢得了尊严，可是我很伤心，什么时候我们伊朗人这样被人看不起了。”我说，“其实这没有什么。当时那些法国人那么看得起你们和之后迪拜人那么欺负人，其实只是看着你们口袋里的钱，而从来都没有看到你们作为人的本身。世界上大多数的人都是这样，这其实也没什么，对吧？”说到这里时间差不多了，我站起身来谢谢Iradj告诉我的故事，Iradj冲着我的背影喊：“我告诉你的不是故事，而是历史。”我回头又郑重地谢谢他跟我分享这些，我为Iradj这种郑重地态度感动。<br><br>

 

 可是事后，我其实对这段对话又想了很多。我觉得其实人对世界的认识很多都是基于个人经历。比如在我看过的历史书和伊朗人写的小说书里，说到巴列维国王和Iradj口中的又是许多不同的角度。我相信Iradj说的都是真实的亲身经历，可是那其实也只是一个局限的角度。我推测了一下，Iradj应该是1967年左右生的，很可能是生在思想开明的知识分子家庭，并且属于当时的利益既得者。所以他的整个家庭应该就会对提倡世俗化社会风尚和富国强民，复兴波斯的巴列维国王支持有加。可是作为王室被推翻前10年才出生地孩子，可能是感受不到其他的部分。比如，其实是穆萨德，伊朗第一个民选首相（非宗教民主人士），将英美操控的石油国有化，还给了伊朗人民，而穆罕穆德礼萨巴列维这位末代的君王恰恰是英美为了自己在伊朗的石油利益而在1953年发动政变，推翻了穆萨德政权而扶持起来的新的伊朗国王。在那个时期，伊朗的经济确实发展很快，可是社会贫富差异加剧，富人穷奢极侈，而穷人却挣扎在温饱线上。长期受伊斯兰教影响很深的伊朗，突然向西方文化快速变革也未必是全部民众，特别是虔诚的什叶派穆斯林所能很容易地过渡和接受的。还有残酷的秘密警察萨瓦克对民众的暴政给人带来的强烈不安全感。这些部分也是历史，也是事实，只是Iradj作为那个社会阶层，作为一个10岁左右的孩子未曾经历的。<br><br>

 

 我想想同一时期，对照中国历史和伊朗历史，真是非常有趣。两个国家都是历史悠久，因此一方面有深厚的文化积淀，另一方面也都背负着各自沉重的历史包袱。伊朗从60年代到现在，经历了多次政变，君主制到宗教领袖；从世俗化西方化，国门大开变成了政教合一，闭关锁国；经历了残酷的战争；经济地位和国际地位的大大下降。作为像Iradj这样的社会阶层，由奢入俭，应该也是看尽了世态炎凉吧。但是比较好的是，在我有限的接触中，我感受到的是这个国家知识分子的尊严和良知。我觉得一个国家确实会因为当权者的政策方针短时间的兴与衰，可是如果在道德文化层面还保留较高的水准，这个国家终究是有希望的。向西也罢，向东也罢，亦东亦西的波斯本色也罢，一个民族的人民怀着自尊，怀着对真善美的信仰，坚韧地追求着自己人生的意义，那么是俭还是奢也不那么重要了吧。伊朗的波斯文明也能得以延续，而这正是伊朗人顺境逆境之下，始终依托着他们的生命的源泉力量吧。<br><br>

 

 中国呢，从60年代到现在，经历了文化大革命的浩劫，在伊朗变成政教合一的国家关上国门的几乎同时，中国打开了改革开放的大门。之后的三十年，我国的所有中心好像都落在经济发展上。这固然有很积极的一面，如今中国已经成为世界第二大经济体，国际地位也大大提升。我们这一代的物质生活是我们父母一代年轻时无法想像的。然而精神世界呢？教育呢？我个人认为是一个可悲的现状。中国人自古以来的夷夏之辩，虽然透露着一种文化的优越感，但孔子在说到夷夏之辩的时候，不是根据血缘或地域来划分的，而是根据这群人实实在在的道德文化素养。所以我们一方面高唱着自己是炎黄子孙，要承继祖先辉煌灿烂的中华文化，另一方面整个社会道德文化的水平是在下降，甚至到了常常被邻邦，被他国看不起的地步。从这个角度，仍站在中华大地上的中国人是不是正在慢慢从实际意义上沦为夷狄呢？<br><br>

 

 伊朗之行带给我最大的感受是：作为中国人，我们是很幸运的，可以说是上天的眷顾。我们的地理位置，决定了我们长期以来大一统的局面。这大一统的局面又换来了延绵不绝，多样，宽容又深厚的文化。我们的民族也经历过很多苦难和危机，可从未被真正地摧垮，这是所有中国人应该庆幸和骄傲的。生命是很短暂的，个人是很渺小的，但是精神世界是可以宏大而丰富的。财富生不带来死不带去，我们应该教育下一代的是要将自己的生命依托于中华文化的深厚土壤上，养成好的人格和接受能力，去随时接纳和欣赏任何有价值的其他文化。<br><br>

 

 快到机场了，Iradj说，“我要感谢大家两件事。感谢大家选择出来看世界，感谢大家选择看世界的时候选择了伊朗，特别是在现在这个时候选择伊朗。希望经过这次的旅程，你们获得亲身的感受，得到属于你们自己的对伊朗人的爱与恨。”<br><br>

 

 他走过来跟我们每一个人拥抱，很温暖地说再见。伊朗是不允许男女有身体接触的，可我知道Iradj不理这一套，我们当然更不理这一套。我很真诚地向他道谢，并且郑重地告诉他我喜欢伊朗人。<br><br>

	<b><a name="T24">《倚天屠龙记》的圣火令</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
阿拉穆特山谷<br><br>

在做行前准备的时候，几乎没有找到什么关于这个山谷的信息，更没有看到有游记提及此地。只是在携程出的行程介绍中看到金庸笔下《倚天屠龙记》中的霍山老人在此修建了阿拉穆特城堡。其实“霍山”在历史上通常翻译成“哈桑”(HassanBinSabbah)，他信的“依斯美良派”其实就是什叶派里的一个极端教派：伊斯玛依派（Ismaili）。霍山生活在公元11世纪，那时候波斯正处在阿拉伯的阿巴斯王朝衰落和突厥人的塞尔柱王朝崛起的战乱时刻，他自创了阿萨辛派（Haschischin），意思是“准备好为某个理由牺牲的人”。这个神秘主义的秘密组织专门对阿拔斯王朝的精英们进行恐怖主义式的大胆处决或政治性的暗杀。Haschischin后来演化成英语里的Assasin，刺客的意思。<br><br>

 

 我家先生是金庸迷，我跟他一说，他立刻翻出相关章节给我看，金庸书中写道，“其时波斯大哲野芒设帐授徒，门下有三个杰出的弟子：峨默长于文学，尼若牟擅于政事，霍山武功精强。西域提起‘山中老人’霍山之名，无不心惊色变。。。”还同时很兴奋地给我这个金庸盲普及了一下关于波斯圣女小昭，殷离唱的《鲁拜集》中的一首诗“来如流水兮逝如风，不知何处来兮何所终！”。这样一来，阿拉穆特山谷在我心中充满了神秘感，很兴奋地想着可以替先生去那里缅怀一下“霍山老人”和他的圣火令。<br><br>

  去阿拉穆特山谷的路上，我们在加兹温落了个脚，顺便看了一座圣殿。伊朗是什叶派穆斯林，追随阿里的直系传人伊玛目。伊玛目及其后人会葬在圣殿。所以我本来还以为圣殿是一个坟墓一类的东西，没想到圣殿也是类似清真寺的样子。圣殿内部用华丽的镜面装饰，亮晶晶的很耀眼，和中国人祭奠先人的传统真是差别很大。善男信女们散坐在地上，或阅读着伊斯兰的典籍或低头沉思。<br><br>




 车快要行进到阿拉穆特山谷时，Iradj说，“这次我们特别为各位安排了阿拉穆特山谷和欧文河，这是一般旅游行程里没有的部分，为的是想各位了解一个全面的伊朗，了解到伊朗不仅有历史人文，还有自然美景。”通常领队小徐会一字不差的翻译，可这次小徐说的是，“各位，虽说这个部分的本意是向大家展示伊朗的自然美景，可是我想给大家先打一声招呼，由于我们是中国来的，这座山和这个湖对各位来说实在不算什么。大家要先有个心理预期，到时候不要太失望。”之后作为金庸迷的小徐兴致勃勃地给大家讲了金庸的《倚天屠龙记》中的相关段落。小徐是个很可爱的女孩，一路上和Iradj配合默契，是少见的领队和本地导游的最佳拍档。在工作之余，Iradj还很热心地教小徐波斯语，小徐也很认真地学，几年下来两人已结下深厚的友谊。我和小徐住一起，夜里有空常常和她聊天，听她讲Iradj一家，讲Mehran，还有一位我未曾谋面但常常和小徐搭档的叫作Panda的导游。小徐口中的这三位，都是知识分子，伊斯兰革命后，生活落差很大，经济压力也很大，他们都有高等学位，有些人还拥有多个学位。可是目前，都一人要打几份工，所做工作也不再是以往那些社会地位高的工作，而只是以挣钱养家为目的的。可是他们还能保持现在这样幽默，勤奋向上，享受生活的心态实属不易。他们都是自尊心很强的人，而且热爱学习，热爱自己的文化。据小徐说他们都很爱聊天，而且很敏感，容易多心又爱解释。我对Iradj的观察也是这样，但是觉得Mehran是安静地很可爱的。小徐说那是因为Mehran的英语不行，在说波斯语的时候他甚至比Iradj还要活泼幽默，滔滔不绝。总之，我很为这几个人的工作关系觉得温馨，真是难得，是不是因为其实伊朗人在精神上还是和中国人有很多相通之处，所以比较容易互相理解和欣赏呢？<br><br>

 

 到了阿拉穆特山谷，我们先看了一个叫做Garmagalu Valley的峡谷，小小的。之后开始爬阿拉穆特山，向山顶的阿拉穆特城堡进发。那座山不太高的，但由于道路没有好好修过，一路爬上去都是土路，脚下常常打滑。干旱地区的山，黄黄的，有些地方有薄薄的一层植被，确实很难与中国的那些名山大川相比。终于眼前出现一座小木门，门上插两面旗，想来这里就是霍山老人藏匿刺客的城堡了。进得门，是一座山洞，穿过山洞，才到了。这些古堡在1256年被蒙古大军所毁，现在只剩一些断垣残壁。从一旁的解说才能看懂这里是一个蓄水池，那里是居民区，总之很需要发挥想象力。<br><br>


 在阿拉穆特山脚下，是碧青的欧文湖，很小很静的一个所在。湖旁有一家人家在野餐，湖水里还冰镇着他们的西瓜。这里胜在安静，除了我们再没有别的游客。和心爱的人在这里野餐，应该会很浪漫呢。<br><br>

 

 阿拉穆特山谷和欧文湖虽然景色并不突出，但对于中国的旅客来说有一种神秘感。同时看看伊朗宁静的乡间，也别具风格。<br><br>

伊朗的拜火教
中国和伊朗的交往源远流长。公元7世纪中叶，萨珊帝国遭受阿拉伯人入侵，萨珊王子卑路斯在唐朝的保护下在长安定居并终老，其时萨珊帝国的国教是拜火教。但在此之前，拜火教早已在公元三、四世纪时经丝绸之路传入中国，被称为祆教，并有设火庙。<br><br>
当时，生活在中亚地区早已信奉拜火教的粟特人在唐朝时不断移民中国，并逐渐成为“昭武九姓”，即：康姓、安姓、米姓、曹姓、史姓、何姓、石姓等等。十六国後赵皇帝石虎的主力部队中有许多拜火教徒，而发动“安史之乱”的安禄山和史思明据说也是拜火教徒。但在公元845年，唐武宗子下诏勒令“大秦穆护祆”的三千多人还俗，拜火教从此在中国走向衰亡。<br><br>
但在中国香港，目前还有约200名拜火教徒。拜火教在香港曾被称为“白头教”，是从印度帕尔西人传过来的。在鸦片战争中，大批的印度拜火教徒到广东经商，其后在辗转到香港。香港拜火教会成立于1850年，现时拜火教会会址位于铜锣湾礼顿道，在一幢商业大厦的外墙上有一个一米乘两米的阿胡拉?马兹达标志，火庙就在大厦里面。<br><br>

一千多年以前，一些拜火教徒从波斯湾乘坐小船逃往印度。他们当年受尽磨难，在印度西海岸的一个岛上坚持了19年，最后与印度当地政府达成协议，最终得以登上印度陆上生存。<br><br>
今日，他们被称为帕尔西人（即波斯人），主要生活在孟买，其人数占全世界拜火教徒的2/3。远离故土的帕尔西人，必须要适应新的国家和习俗。譬如，因为印度崇拜牛，他们在祭祀的时候便用羊来代替牛；印度没有豪麻，便用其他植物代替。尽管如此，帕尔西人仍最大地坚持传统，努力和故土的拜火教徒们取得联系。他们最终在16世纪互相知道对方的存在，从那时开始，印度帕尔西人和伊朗拜火教徒联系密切。<br><br>
帕尔西人（Parsi）在印度多以经商为主，大多殷实富有。印度著名的塔塔集团，就是拜火教徒为主的财团之一，总资产额高达150亿美元的塔塔集团，是印度顶尖财团之一。<br><br>

1． 拜火教，即琐罗亚斯德教（Zoroastrianism），中国古籍记载为祆教（祆xian，音“掀”）、火祆教，是世界上最古老的宗教（比犹太教、基督教、佛教和伊斯兰教至少早了1000年）。拜火教的创立者琐罗亚斯德是古波斯的一位伟大先知，据说生于公元前11世纪（学术界对确切时间并无定论），他得到光明世界的主宰阿胡拉.马兹达（Ahura Mazda ，Ahura是“神”，Mazda是“伟大”）的神启，在古代雅利安人多神教的基础上建立琐罗亚斯德。其基本教义是善恶二元神论，奉《阿维斯塔》（即《波斯古经》）为经典。拜火教徒必须恪守的三善原则――善思、善言和善行，只有恪守三善原则，才能战胜邪恶和黑暗。<br><br>
拜火教徒相信，阿胡拉・马兹达创造了七大善物，分别是：天空、大地、水、植物、动物、人和火。至今，7这个数字在伊朗人里面仍然具有吉祥的意义。火对拜火教徒来说是神圣的，代表光明和生命，也正因为如此，琐罗亚斯德教被称为拜火教，尽管这并不是很严谨的说法。据出土文物证明，拜火教至少在公元前1100年就已在两河流域（伊拉克）和今伊朗地区流行，在阿契美尼德王朝(公元前550年－前330年)时期，成为波斯帝国的国教，并在萨珊王朝(公元224－651年)臻于全盛，并传播到中亚广大地区甚至中国。<br><br>
但公元7世纪，阿拉伯铁骑征服波斯并实行伊斯兰化政策，大多数波斯人接受了伊斯兰教，拜火教从此日渐式微。但即使今天，在穆斯林占了人口98%的伊朗本土上，仍有极少数的拜火教徒恪守祖先的宗教，在伊斯兰世界维系古老的波斯文明。因为他们不和外界通婚，保留了古波斯语（现代波斯语已使用阿拉伯字母，有40%词汇来自阿拉伯文），因而成为比其他伊朗人“更纯正的波斯人”。<br><br>
而根据历史记载，明教是波斯传到中国的摩尼教。摩尼教的创始人摩尼出生于公元216年，他当时在拜火教教义的基础上创立了摩尼教。但源自拜火教的摩尼教从没有对波斯产生深远的影响，该教在唐朝的时候传入中国。被称为“明教”、“二尊教”等。当时，中国各地都建有摩尼教寺院，称为“大云光明寺”。在《倚天屠龙记》里面，明教教徒爱穿白衣，不吃肉食（老谋深算的朱元璋除外）等，这是因为摩尼教与拜火教一样崇尚白色的光明。<br><br>
因此有一点要特别指出：《倚天屠龙记》的年代是元末明初，元朝在1368灭亡。其时的波斯，已是蒙古-突厥人统治的伊斯兰国家。经过阿拉伯人数百年强大的改宗运动，大多数拜火教徒改信伊斯兰教，波斯帝国的国教――拜火教被伊斯兰教取代。可以想见的是，拜火教乃至摩尼教的力量在元末明初的伊朗微乎其微，不太可能像《倚天屠龙记》描写的“明教总部使者”那样拥有强大的势力，“手持圣火令便可指挥中国明教教主”、“派出圣女搜集古经书”云云。<br><br>
也许金大侠在书中稍微错用了一下时间概念，因为是文学作品，金大侠自然没有必要完全根据历史线索来写。《倚天屠龙记》仍是一部精彩的武侠小说。<br><br>

公元7世纪中叶后，波斯人在阿拉伯人的统治下面临两个选择：一是改信伊斯兰教，成为和阿拉伯人平等的穆斯林；一是保持原有的宗教，但必须课以重税并低人一等。因此，绝大多数拜火教徒不得不接受了新的宗教。<br><br>
但一批不想交重税又不愿意改宗的拜火教徒则选择离开家乡，远涉重洋移民到印度西海岸，发展为印度一个新的少数民族帕尔西人（Parsis，即波斯人）。当今分布在全球各地的拜火教徒人数里面，帕尔西人占了2/3。（关于全球拜火教徒的人数，目前并无一个准确的数字：一说为15万人，其中3万左右在伊朗；而伊朗拜火教徒却对我表示，目前伊朗有不到10万拜火教徒。按照这个比例，全球的拜火教徒很可能达30万左右。）<br><br>
就在伊朗成为伊斯兰国家后，人们包括伊朗人都几乎淡忘了拜火教在其本土的存在。但真实的历史情况是：拜火教并没有在波斯本土湮没，尽管人数很少，但虔诚的教徒们在故土顽强地生存下来。目前，朗拜火教徒主要分布在伊朗中部亚兹德和首都德黑兰。<br><br>

 

阿拉伯人摧毁了伊朗的拜火教、摧毁了中亚和南亚的佛教、摧毁了古埃及文明（科普特）・・・・・・阿拉伯人可谓历史上最成功的殖民征服者之一，在其大部分征服地中，包括今伊拉克、叙利亚、巴勒斯坦、黎巴嫩、埃及、苏丹北部、利比亚、突尼斯、阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥等，原居住民族都基本上被成功清除，这些地方如今全成了阿拉伯之地。不过可笑的是，如今的伊朗人却成了被强加于其的那个宗教的忠实卫道士。――阿拉伯人比蒙古人厉害，或者说穆罕默德比成吉思汗厉害？――有人这样说：阿拉伯帝国建立之后，除了将阿拉伯语定为波斯的官方语言之外，还从宗教方面同化波斯人，他们对琐罗亚斯德教徒提供三种选择：死、改宗、交人丁税和土地税，其中土地税至少高出1倍以上。一部分不堪忍受宗教迫害和屈辱的人丁税、土地税的波斯人逃离本土，这才有了以后的帕尔西人。 说起来痛心呀，阿拉伯帝国的建立者----那些来自蛮荒之地的、文明等级极低的、游牧的贝都因人，之所以能够灭亡中古时期世界最高等级文明之一的波斯萨珊王朝，完全是因为统治者内部原因，萨珊一朝，穷兵黩武，和拜占庭帝国之间的战争耗尽了国力，加之统治者骄糜奢侈，弄得国内民怨载道、危机四伏，这是根本原因。琐罗亚斯德教也已经由一种简朴的宗教发展到内部等级森严、特权严重、职位世袭的地步，引起广大教徒和人民的不满，这也是很多人转宗成为穆斯林的重要原因。<br><br>

	<hr><br>
 据说，伊朗的一半政治权力在库姆。 <br><br> 
 
 <a href= "pic08.html">伊朗旅游地图</a><br><br>

 库姆，位于伊朗首都德黑兰以南135公里处，在1979年伊朗伊斯兰革命推翻巴列维王朝的运动中，库姆发挥了很大的作用。伊朗伊斯兰共和国创始人、已故伊朗最高宗教领袖霍梅尼，以及当今伊朗最高领袖哈梅内伊、前总统拉夫桑贾尼和哈塔米都曾在库姆的神学院任教或学习。一个伊朗朋友对我说过：“库姆的水都带着咸味。”由于处在沙漠中，长久以来库姆城都依赖坎儿井供水，条件十分恶劣，很难想象这个城市竟然发展成为伊斯兰什叶派的圣城和伊朗的权力中心。  <br><br>   
 库姆城是库姆省省会，人口大概120多万。库姆位于伊朗北部山区和卡维尔大盐漠之间的一块低地。其和首都德黑兰虽然相距135公里，气候却相差很大。从德黑兰驱车往南，很快就发现自己处在荒漠中孤零零的高速路上，零零落落一些干枯的植物艰难地长在无垠的盐碱地中，远远就能看见一个白花花的大盐湖。    <br><br>
 前往库姆，刚好碰上“阿舒拉”。进入库姆城，便看到处处挂着黑布或者旗帜，上面写着悼念伊玛目侯赛因的赞语和哀辞。悼念的游行队伍，络绎不绝地穿城而过，走到库姆的最古老、什叶派主要朝觐圣祠马苏麦清真寺广场中间。有着金顶、气势宏伟的马苏麦圣祠，是什叶派第八伊玛目阿里的妹妹法蒂玛的陵墓，建于公元9世纪初。一千多年来，什叶派穆斯林笃信朝觐这座圣陵是高尚的虔诚行为。<br><br>

一本书上曾经这样写道，“在库姆，旅游者会被认为是一种奇怪的动物”。马苏麦圣祠一般来说是拒绝非穆斯林进入的，但我刚好赶上阿舒拉节，这时前来库姆朝圣和悼念的穆斯林非常多，我也得以进入清真寺里面一看了。圣祠入口是严格分开男女的，我刚跨进女宾入口，一个管理人员拿着鸡毛掸子在我面前一挡，严肃地说：“查朵儿！”（chador，是伊朗穆斯林从头包到脚的一种黑袍）。我看看进去的伊朗妇女，她们都穿着这种黑袍。管理员示意我从旁边的小房间里面取一件查朵儿穿上才能进去，出来后要归还。     <br><br>
清真寺里面有一个很宽阔的广场，中间有一道栏杆，男性在另一边举行阿舒拉悼念活动，女人们在栏杆这一边坐在毯子上默默悼念，她们除了很少几个小孩子外，都裹着黑色的查朵儿，眼前黑压压一片。我需要一手扯住查朵儿一手拍照片，有点狼狈不堪，查朵儿不小心滑下来，被里面的管理员用鸡毛掸子提醒了几次。这让我感觉鸡毛掸子原来是这么有权力的。      <br><br>
近些年来，德黑兰姑娘的袍子越来越短，头巾的颜色也越来越花哨，到处可见商店里挂着性感晚礼服、超短裙。和时髦现代化的德黑兰相比，库姆的宗教气氛浓厚了许多，人们也非常保守。除了七八岁以下的小女孩，即使在大街上，女人们也大多裹着黑袍――这个城市的颜色是伊斯兰传统的黑色。     <br><br>
去库姆之前，我已经在服装上作了准备，行头是：一件及膝的黑色袍子、一条黑色套头头巾，把头发和脖子部分全都盖起来，比一些德黑兰姑娘的大阪还要保守。尽管如此，因为我没有裹黑袍而引起一些虔诚穆斯林的不满，好几次有人指着我的服装表示不够。在大街上，一个老头冲我嚷嚷非得我穿上chador。<br><br>

库姆分布着150多座规模不同，风格各异的清真寺。各座清真寺的圆形屋顶、庄严肃穆的拱门和耸入云端的宣礼塔和尖形塔顶，都使这座圣城充满浓厚的伊斯兰色彩。<br><br>
城内没有高层建筑，安静而朴素。临街大多是3、4层的建筑，大多民居是泥砖或者泥巴盖成的传统房屋。这里最大的特点就是到处可见毛拉走在路上（毛拉，是伊斯兰教神职人员和学者的尊称）。<br><br>
从公元9世纪开始，库姆成为什叶派的领导中心地。这里有多所历史悠久的神学院，是什叶派的伊斯兰神学教育和研究中心。伊朗伊斯兰共和国创始人、已故伊朗最高领袖霍梅尼以及其他无数什叶派阿亚图拉（伊斯兰教什叶派高级神职称呼）均在此研究和学习神学。目前，仍有一批一批高级神学家长期住在这里，从事伊斯兰宗教研究，著书立说。目前，在库姆学习的学生约有两万多人，不少来自外国。<br><br>
库姆的神学院大多和清真寺连在一起，其中最著名的有600年历史的菲伊齐耶神学院。菲伊齐耶神学院位于马苏麦圣祠后面，门口有士兵守卫着，我在大门外排了一张照片，他马上过来表示神学院里面不能拍照。伊朗大多数清真寺都由伊朗革命卫队负责安全，神学院也不例外。士兵还表示，神学院平常不允许外人进入，但今天因为是节日而例外，允许我们进去。神学院里面是传统的波斯庭院，房子分布在四周，中间是一池清泉。传统拱形的教室一小间一小间分布绕着门廊，老师和学生都盘坐在地毯上谈经讲道。      <br><br>
在这里，我见到一名头缠黑色头巾的中年神职人员赛义德.侯赛尼。他是这所神学院的学生，在这里已经学习了12年。据他介绍，曾经有无数高级神学家曾在菲伊齐耶神学院学习和任教，其中就包括已故伊朗最高领袖霍梅尼。     <br><br>
1922年，年仅20岁的霍梅尼开始在库姆学习伊斯兰法学，27岁便开始在库姆讲授伊斯兰神学和哲学，上世纪60年初便成为伊朗什叶派六大阿亚图拉之一。霍梅尼在库姆很有声望，他抨击巴列维国王“亲美”，号召穆斯林发起推翻巴列维王朝的“反国王运动”。1964年11月，霍梅尼被伊朗特工绑架流放土耳其，1965年被转送伊拉克圣城纳杰夫。他于1979年2月1日返回德黑兰，推翻了巴列维王朝，成立伊朗伊斯兰共和国。     在1964年离开伊朗之前，霍梅尼一直深居于库姆，其故居仍保留着。事实上，霍梅尼故居只是一座不大的传统泥砖房子，到目前为止都没有什么修饰，如果不是外面有一个写着“霍梅尼房子”的牌子，经过这堵有点剥落的泥墙谁也不会注意。但霍梅尼就在这里讲经布道，发动了轰动世界的伊朗伊斯兰革命。和其他国家的名人故居不同，霍梅尼故居不能随便参观，近日它仍是高级神职人员布道的重要场所，男女严格分开，照相机等器材不能带进去。     <br><br>

我进去的那两个小间，上面铺着地毯，女人们坐在地毯上静静地听着从喇叭传过来的讲道（事实上毛拉就在隔壁房间，但女人是看不到的）。红茶是免费的，负责茶水的大妈就坐在角落，要几杯茶都可以。走的时候我给她塞了几颗糖，以表示对她的感谢。<br><br>

库姆培养了3个伊朗总统<br><br>
内贾德的精神导师在库姆<br><br>
伊斯兰革命成功以后，霍梅尼根据自己的政治理念在伊朗实行了一种政教合一、神权高于一切的政治体制。这种政治体制大致分为两大系统：宗教领袖系统和政府系统。宗教领袖系统是监护系统，拥有绝对的权力，凌驾于立法、行政和司法三个政府部门之上；而政府系统具体管理国家，其中议会和总统由普选产生，但都要在宗教领袖的监护下运作。       <br><br>
但根据伊朗伊斯兰共和国的宪法，最高领袖背后还有一个监督机构――专家会议。这个由86名伊斯兰教神职人员组成的机构不仅有选举和监督最高领袖的权力，而且在领袖不称职或其他必要之时，还可以将其废黜。因此，伊朗当今的政权实际上仍然掌握在以最高领袖为首的一些高级神职人员手中。这些神职人员当中很多人仍然住在库姆的一些窄街陋巷内，他们对伊朗的大政方针仍然有着非常重要的影响力。      <br><br>
1979年以来，伊朗的两任最高领袖均在库姆神学院任教和学习，其中目前最高领袖和前总统哈梅内伊是霍梅尼的学生，而伊朗前两任总统：拉夫桑贾尼14岁开始便在库姆学习，受教于霍梅尼；哈塔米18岁开始在库姆学习，其妻子是霍梅尼的孙女。即便是当前总统艾哈迈迪-内贾德，其精神导师、专家会议成员之一阿亚图拉亚兹迪也长期住在库姆，亚兹迪亦曾受教于霍梅尼。  <br><br>    
亚兹迪在伊朗目前是较有影响力的阿亚图拉之一，他宣扬应建立保守的伊斯兰国家，坚持伊朗的核计划，反对向美国妥协。我在库姆一座清真寺里面的书店里面，看到陈列着不少亚兹迪的著作。内贾德受亚兹迪的影响较大，2005年内贾德当选总统成功后，其姐姐曾代表内贾德前往库姆感谢亚兹迪对内贾德的帮助和支持。<br><br>

16世纪初，萨法维王朝宣布伊斯兰教什叶派中的十二伊玛目派为国教。萨法维王朝在库姆大兴土木，修缮和扩建清真寺。但随着20世纪20年代巴列维王朝建立和向西方靠近，库姆一度萧条冷落。<br><br>
1979年伊斯兰革命后，库姆又重新兴起，兴建了从德黑兰到库姆的高速路，库姆也成为从首都到其他地方的交通枢纽。尽管库姆在伊朗是保守和传统的代名词，但随着近年来伊朗社会的逐渐开放和全球化的影响，库姆也逐渐走向现代化。   <br><br>   
在库姆，我也不时能看到留着长发的男孩子，少数女孩子虽然穿着黑袍，但也淡淡抹上口红，穿上高跟鞋。年轻人拿着时髦的手机拍照，看见我们外国人热情地打招呼。而在圣祠外面的一个小商贩，他经营的小玩具里面，居然有一个圣诞老人。<br><br>      
其实，包括以保守著称的内贾德精神导师亚兹迪等宗教人士，都建起了自己的博客，通过网络这种现代化的工具布道。<br><br>

什叶派的摇篮――库姆<br><br>

库姆是伊斯兰什叶派圣城，位于今伊朗首都德黑兰以南约150公里处。它是德黑兰最大的邻居，北邻德黑兰和萨姆南省，南接伊斯法罕省，东濒中央省。从德黑兰出发花一天的时间便可从容地参观库姆城。<br><br>

Qom一词是阿拉伯命令语态含有“起来”之意。什叶派的许多圣训都宣称库姆曾是该派避难的地方。816~817年间，什叶派第八代伊玛目阿里・本・穆萨・里扎之寻法蒂玛・马尔苏玛因探望其兄，途经库姆时病故，后建陵墓于库姆河南岸，称为马尔苏玛墓。1501年萨法维王朝宣传什叶派为国家教派，并设总部于库姆。在国王的命令下，库姆得到全面整修。马尔苏玛墓以花砖金箔。墓北建礼拜大殿和唤拜楼；并辟有宽阔的广场，以供商贾贸易。库姆作为圣地的名声日隆。<br><br>

到了萨法维王朝阿巴斯一世大帝(1588~1629)，又号召什叶派穆斯林瞻仰库姆与马什哈德伊玛目里扎陵墓。当时，伊斯兰学者云集库姆，宗教教育大大发展。名人陵墓也随之增多。从此，库姆圣地的地位确立，至今不衰。<br><br>

在库姆建有伊斯兰世界闻名的、培养什叶派宗教学者的库姆宗教学院。除伊朗本国以外，还接纳来自伊斯兰各国的留学生。什叶派不少宗教学家、法学家，包括有名的教法创制者、阿亚图拉皆出自该学院。1935年筹建的库姆博物馆位于马尔苏玛陵墓大殿的西面，内藏《古兰经》手抄珍本等文物。陵墓旁还建有一座大清真寺。<br><br>

库姆的天空<br><br>

巴扎：<br><br>

伊朗无与伦比的建筑总是让人眼花缭乱。事实上，当你来到库姆，这里真正吸引你的已经不再是那些令人叹为观止的伊斯兰建筑了，这座城市对于一个非宗教游客来说最大的吸引力是那里众多虔诚的瞻仰者。<br><br>

走大街上，便于工作可能看到那些区别于我们的瞻仰者。对于他们来说，来到库姆旅行本身便是他们一生梦想的实现。有头戴黑色或白色的缠头巾、身着优质亚麻布衣的尊贵的毛拉，有来这里出售商品的小商人。<br><br>

除了周五，你来这里都可赶上巴扎。一路走下去，挑挑拣拣，便可以看到出售的蜡烛、念珠、礼拜用毯、泥制叩首石、彩色泥制小动物。成堆艳艳的石榴让人馋涎欲滴，有一种名叫“苏罕”的糖果小吃是当地的美味糖果，不妨品尝一下。那是一种用压碎了的开心果仁制成的糖果，是当地的土特产，几乎在城里每一条主要大街上都可以看到。它不像其他的伊朗糖果那样甜腻人，而是令人入口难忘。<br><br>

陵园的博物馆<br><br>

当你站在奥斯汤奈广场上的时候，看到两座墙上装饰有优美精致的马赛克釉砖的建筑就是陵园的博物馆了。馆藏展品有《古兰经》手抄本、许多极富价值的古代器皿、纺织品和锦缎等。<br><br>

萨法维王朝的历代国王捐赠的各种精美的挂毯在这里都可以一睹为快。<br><br>


　库姆，位于伊朗首都德黑兰以南135公里处。这里拥有伊朗一半的政治权力。许多伊朗政治、宗教领袖都在这里的神学院任教或学习过。日前，《世界新闻报》记者探访了这个伊斯兰教什叶派圣城。<br><br>

　　记者前往库姆刚好碰上“阿舒拉节”。阿舒拉是什叶派穆斯林在伊斯兰阴历1月10日最重要的宗教纪念日。每年这个时候，伊朗全国各地会以各种方式，缅怀公元680年在卡尔巴拉战死的穆罕默德的外孙、什叶派穆斯林第三位教长伊玛目侯赛因。<br><br>

　　进入库姆城，便看到处处挂着黑布或者旗帜，上面写着悼念伊玛目侯赛因的哀辞。悼念的游行队伍，络绎不绝地穿城而过，走到库姆的最古老、什叶派主要朝觐圣祠――马苏麦清真寺广场中间。<br><br>

　　清真寺内出借黑袍<br><br>

　　记者着装被人提醒<br><br>

　　一本书上曾经这样写道：“在库姆，旅游者会被认为是一种奇怪的动物。”马苏麦圣祠一般是拒绝非穆斯林进入的，但由于赶上阿舒拉节，记者有幸进入了清真寺。<br><br>

　　圣祠入口是严格分开男女的。记者刚跨进女宾入口，一个管理人员就拿着鸡毛掸子在记者面前一挡，严肃地说：“查朵儿！”（查朵儿是伊朗穆斯林从头包到脚的一种黑袍）。于是，管理员示意记者从旁边的小房间里取一件查朵儿穿上才能进去，出来后要归还。<br><br>

　　清真寺里的广场很宽阔，中间有一道栏杆，男性在另一边举行阿舒拉悼念活动，女人们在栏杆这边坐在毯子上默默悼念。她们除了很少几个小孩子外，都裹着黑色的查朵儿。因为记者要一手扯住查朵儿一手拍照片，查朵儿好几次不小心滑下来，都被管理员提醒了。<br><br>

　　近些年来，首都德黑兰姑娘的袍子越来越短，头巾的颜色也越来越花哨，到处可见商店里挂着性感晚礼服、超短裙。和时髦现代化的德黑兰相比，库姆的宗教气氛浓厚了许多，人们也非常保守。除了七八岁以下的小女孩，即使在大街上，女人们也大多裹着黑袍――库姆的颜色是黑色。<br><br>

　　去库姆前，记者已经在服装上做了准备：一件及膝的黑色袍子、一条黑色套头头巾，把头发和脖子部分全都盖起来。尽管如此，因为记者没有裹黑袍，好几次被虔诚的穆斯林提醒。有人还指着记者的服装表示，这样的穿着不够保守。<br><br>

霍梅尼故居泥墙剥落<br><br>

　　士兵把守在神学院外<br><br>

　　库姆分布着150多座规模不同、风格各异的清真寺。各座清真寺的圆形屋顶、庄严肃穆的拱门和耸入云端的宣礼塔和尖形塔顶，都使这座圣城充满浓厚的伊斯兰色彩。城内没有高层建筑，临街大多是三四层的建筑，大多民居是泥砖或者泥巴盖成的。这里最大的特点就是到处可见毛拉走在路上（毛拉，是伊斯兰教神职人员和学者的尊称）。<br><br>

　　从公元9世纪开始，库姆成为什叶派的领导中心地。目前，在库姆学习的学生约有两万多人，不少来自外国。<br><br>

　　库姆的神学院大多和清真寺连在一起，其中最著名的是有600年历史的菲伊齐耶神学院。菲伊齐耶神学院位于马苏麦圣祠后面，门口有士兵守卫着，记者在大门外拍了一张照片，他马上过来阻止。伊朗大多数清真寺都由伊朗革命卫队负责安全，神学院也不例外。神学院里面是传统的波斯庭院，房子分布在四周，中间是一池清泉。传统拱形的教室一小间一小间地绕着门廊分布，老师和学生都盘坐在地毯上谈经讲道。<br><br>

　　记者见到一名头缠黑色头巾的中年神职人员赛义德・侯赛尼。他在这里已经学习了12年。据他介绍，曾经有无数高级神学家在菲伊齐耶神学院学习和任教，其中就包括已故伊朗最高领袖霍梅尼。<br><br>

　　在1964年离开伊朗之前，霍梅尼一直深居于库姆，其故居仍保留着。事实上，霍梅尼故居只是一座不大的传统泥砖房子，到目前为止都没有什么修饰。如果不是外面有一个写着“霍梅尼房子”的牌子，经过这堵有点剥落的泥墙谁也不会注意。但霍梅尼就在这里讲经布道，发动了轰动世界的伊朗伊斯兰革命。和其他国家的名人故居不同，霍梅尼故居不能随便参观。它仍是高级神职人员布道的重要场所，男女严格分开，照相机等器材不能带进去。<br><br>

　　培养过三任总统<br><br>

　　内贾德前去寻师<br><br>

　　伊斯兰革命成功以后，霍梅尼根据自己的政治理念在伊朗实行了一种政治体制。这种政治体制大致分为两大系统：宗教领袖系统和政府系统。宗教领袖系统是监护系统；政府系统具体管理国家，其中议会和总统由普选产生，但都要在宗教领袖的监护下运作。<br><br>

　　根据伊朗伊斯兰共和国的宪法，最高领袖背后还有一个监督机构――专家会议。这个由86名伊斯兰教神职人员组成的机构，不仅有选举和监督最高领袖的权力，而且在领袖不称职或其他必要之时，还可以将其废黜。因此，伊朗当今的政权，实际上仍然掌握在以最高领袖为首的神职人员手中。这些人对伊朗的大政方针，仍然有着非常重要的影响力。<br><br>

　　1979年以来，伊朗的两任最高领袖均在库姆神学院任教和学习，目前的最高领袖和前总统哈梅内伊是霍梅尼的学生，而伊朗前两任总统――拉夫桑贾尼14岁开始便在库姆学习，受教于霍梅尼；哈塔米18岁开始在库姆学习，其妻子是霍梅尼的孙女。即便是现任总统艾哈迈迪-内贾德，其精神导师、专家会议成员之一的阿亚图拉・亚兹迪也长期住在库姆，亚兹迪亦曾受教于霍梅尼。亚兹迪在伊朗目前是较有影响力的阿亚图拉（伊斯兰教什叶派一分支对高级教职人员的尊称）之一，他宣扬应建立保守的伊斯兰国家，坚持伊朗的核计划，反对向美国妥协。<br><br>

　　记者在库姆一座清真寺的书店里，看到陈列着不少亚兹迪的著作。内贾德受亚兹迪的影响较大，2005年内贾德当选总统成功后，其姐姐曾代表内贾德，前往库姆感谢亚兹迪的帮助和支持。<br><br>

 世界第一大帝国的缔造者<br><br>

――居鲁士二世<br><br>

 

预言他将成为亚细亚霸主的梦让刚出世的居鲁士二世险些命丧黄泉，死里逃生的居鲁士带领波斯一鸣惊人，开创了帝国。他成就霸业的过人才智，令敌人都钦佩的强烈个人魅力，还有让各族臣服的开明宽仁，都不愧“宇宙四方之王”之称。<br><br>

 

多舛的童年<br><br>

虽然拥有高贵的血统和地位，但是居鲁士却着多舛坎坷的成长历程。从母亲怀孕起，死神就一直在这个小生命的身边徘徊，使他陷于这种危险境遇的，源于外公的两个噩梦。居鲁士的外公是米底国王阿斯提亚格斯，在一次梦中，他见到女儿曼丹妮撒的尿变成滔天河水，淹没了整个亚洲。解梦的祭司声称，这预示着公证将对王国造成极大的威胁，于是国王决定把女儿嫁给性格温顺老实的波斯贵族冈比西斯，这样既可以让女儿远离米底政权，又让女儿处于一个无力与米底抗衡的国家。可是不久之后，另一个噩梦让国王忧心更甚：这一次他梦见曼丹妮的肚子里长出一树葡萄藤，它茂盛成长，最后枝叶遮住了整个亚洲。对此，祭司声称，这个梦预示着公证的孩子不但要摧毁米底王国，还将成为整个亚细亚的霸主。这了免除后患，国王急忙将已经怀孕的女儿召回国，并决定孩子一旦出生，就立即处死。不过人算不如天算，国王将杀婴的任务交给管家哈尔帕哥斯，管家又交给牧人，牧人却用妻子刚产生的死婴将孩子掉了包，于是公主的孩子以奴隶的身份存活下来。十年后，在一次扮演国王的游戏中，被伙伴选为“国王”的小居鲁士惩罚了一名不听号令的贵族小孩，随后事情的发展就像被推倒的多米诺骨牌，小居鲁身份被揭穿，国王发现十年来的高枕无忧竟是一场骗局，大发雷霆，不仅处死了管家的独生子，还让管家吃下亲生儿子做成的菜肴，巨大的与愤怒在管家心里幻化成强烈的复仇种子。相比之下小居鲁士这次就幸运得多，他被欢蹦乱跳地送回了波斯，因为祭司认为：小居鲁士在游戏中扮演过国王之后，就不可能在现实中再次成为国王，他对米底王位的威胁已经解除。<br><br>

“宇宙四方之王”<br><br>

公元前558年，居鲁士成为波斯首领，他举起了反抗米底的大旗，阿斯提亚格斯得知后立即调兵迎战，哈尔帕哥斯被任命为统帅，隐忍多年的管家早已和居鲁士达成密约，率领大军阵前倒戈，米底王国元气大伤，之后两者的战争虽延续了三年，但米底王国的败局早已注定。公元前550年，阿斯提亚格斯兵败被俘，米底灭亡。由此居鲁士正式建立波斯帝国，开始了帝国辉煌的征程。外公被居鲁士奉养于宫中，亲眼目睹在居鲁士的带领下，波斯帝国犹如滚滚洪流席卷亚洲，它茂盛的枝叶逐渐延展，遮蔽了亚洲的天空。<br><br>

这位足智多谋的国王，几十年内不单灭了米底、吕底亚、新巴比伦三大王国，还使犹太、腓尼基、地中海东岸至中亚的广阔地区臣服于他脚下。在迁都巴比伦之时，这位伟大的君主还自豪地宣称自己是“宇宙四方之王”。<br><br>

霸主的尊荣<br><br>

在征服的广袤地域上，居鲁士用宽厚胸襟对待被征服地区的人民，这与亚述帝国的残暴征服和血腥屠杀形成鲜明的对比。他推行开朗的宗教政策，尊重各地的宗教和风俗，让被征服地的民族继续信奉自己的神祗，他还让在新巴比伦时代沦为“巴比伦之囚”的犹太人重回圣城耶路撒冷，让他们重建圣殿，编纂经典。这件事被犹太人载于《圣经》中，他们称居鲁士为“上帝的工具”、“使列国降伏在他面前”、“使城门在他面前敞开”。就连长期与波斯敌对的希腊人也承认居鲁士是令人佩服的君主。因此，在居鲁士的统治之下，波斯帝国一直繁荣稳定，没有出现亚述帝国那种此起彼伏的起义和反抗。<br><br>

公元前529年，居鲁士率兵想要征服马萨格泰人，在波斯人的眼中，这个游牧民族贫弱落后，还由一个寡妇(国王死后，他的妻子继承了王位)。不料女王托米丽斯采取了强硬的态度，誓与波斯军队对抗到底。战争的结果不但波斯全军覆没，居鲁士的头颅还被女王割下放在盛满鲜血的皮囊中，以报复居鲁士的杀子之仇。她以此实践自己的誓言，让居鲁士“饱饮鲜血”。<br><br>

最后，居鲁士被安葬在帕萨尔加德，至今已有2500年的陵墓旁，刻有铭文的柱子上写道：“我，居鲁士，世界之王，伟大的王。”<br><br>

居鲁士死后，遗体归葬故都帕萨尔加德(位于今伊朗法尔斯省)。他赢得了永久的尊敬。200年后，灭亡波斯帝国的亚历山大大帝从希腊东征到此，不仅没有毁坏他的陵墓，相反还下令加以修葺。居鲁士陵2500年来屹立不倒，在陵墓旁的一根柱子上，一段铭文至今清晰可见：“我是居鲁士王，阿契美尼德宗室。”<br><br>




“铁血大帝”――大流士一世<br><br>

他不是第一位所向无敌的征服者，却是第一位具有世界眼光的统治者；他以武力为根基，摘取了世界帝国的桂冠；他所开创的行省制、军区制、货币税收制度等，深刻地影响了后来的罗马、阿拉伯、奥斯曼等世界性大帝国。他，就是“铁血大帝”，“众王之王”――大流士一世！<br><br>

因马鸣而得天下<br><br>

公元前522年3月11日的一场政变，造就了大流士出人头地的机遇。当时担任波斯宫廷总管的高墨达抓住冈比西斯久居埃及的绝好机遇，以王弟巴尔迪亚自居，发动了政变。历史却又那么凑巧，当年冈比西斯秘密处死弟弟的行为并无人知晓，而高墨达的长相与巴尔迪亚好似双胞胎，人们自然都信以为真。高墨达见帝国境内已承认自己，便推行了许多新政，力图恢复米底王国的势力。纸究竟包不住火，在高墨达当政第八个月时，贵族欧塔涅斯用巧计证实了他是假的巴尔迪亚，并召开贵族会议商量对策。王族出身的大流士力主趁高墨达羽毛未丰之际，果断出击，以恢复波斯帝国的统治。大流士的这一主张提到了其他密谋者的一致同意，于是，大流士就以贵族的身份，以父亲想面见国王为借口，混进了王宫，处死了高墨达，从而获得了平定内乱的初步胜利。<br><br>

大流士初战告捷，为进一步平息帝国的内乱打下了基础。但现在突出的问题是，偌大的国家到底由谁来统治，七人同盟为此争论不休。无奈之中，他们寄希望于神意来决他们的命运：他们相约第二天日出时，在市郊集合，谁的马第一个鸣叫，谁就是波斯王。蓄谋已久的大流士串通马夫，耍了个花招，让他的马第一个叫了起来。巧合的是，同时天出异象，晴空万里却电闪雷鸣，其他六人慌忙下马跪拜，俯首称臣，以为是神选定了大流士做国王，大流士遂刻“叙司塔司佩斯的儿子大流士因他的马和马夫之功勋赢得了波斯国王”的铭文，作为王位的佐证，大流士就这样轻而易举地登上了波斯王的宝座。<br><br>

残酷的铁血政策<br><br>

大流士成为庞大帝国的一国之君后，面临的国内形势依然非常严峻，巴比伦、米底、埃兰、亚述、帕提亚及西徐亚等地纷纷举起了起义的旗帜。既有被征服地区人民反波斯统治起义，也有波斯贵族内部争权夺利的斗争，这是对即位新君的一个极大的考验。大流士对此毫不手软，以铁和血的武力手段回敬各地的起义浪潮。公元前522年12月，大流士亲率军队，用大规模的残酷镇压，平定了巴比伦的起义。之后，大流士乘胜追击，耗时两年多，历经18次战役并以10万人命丧战场的代价又平定了各地的起义，挽救了风雨飘摇的波斯帝国。在班师回朝的路途中，踌躇满志的大流士国王，命人在“神仙之地”的悬崖峭壁处，用古波斯、埃兰和巴比伦三种文字，刻下《贝希斯顿铭文》以记载自己的丰功伟绩，其目的是要使自己的功德流芳百世。大流士万万没有想到，他的这一心血来潮之作却成为近代罗林逊破译楔形文字，并进而重新认识古代西亚文明的窗口。<br><br>

波斯帝国重新一统后，大流士并没有停息下来，很快便踏上了对外扩张、开疆扩土著人的征途。他先将扩张的步伐迈向印度，在大获全胜后，波斯大军的脚步不曾迟疑，又踏上了征服西徐亚人的地盘。令大流士沮丧的是，西徐亚人与波斯军队展开了灵活的游击战，疲惫不堪的帝国军队只得无功而返。当历史的车轮驶入公元前6世纪末，世界历史上第一个横跨欧、亚、非三大洲的大帝国――波斯帝国形成了。它的疆域北抵亚美尼亚，南至埃塞俄比亚，东依古老的印度河，西触爱琴文明的沃土。帝国版图幅员辽阔，人口众多，种族各异，在古代三大文明圈的圣光照耀之下，文化丰富发达，呈现出一片生机勃勃的景象。就这样，“众王之王”大流士一世踩着居鲁士父子搭起的帝国天梯，以铁血的手腕，登上了帝国天梯的最高阶梯，并且摘取了世界帝国的桂冠，成为世界历史上最早的横跨欧亚非三大洲的军事帝国。<br><br>

卓越的政治才干<br><br>

如果说居鲁士是帝国的开山鼻祖，那么，大流士便是帝国的维系者和经营者。自居鲁士、冈比西斯至大流士，虽然以志存域外、气吞八方的气势，用武力横扫天下，但是具有卓越政治才干的大流士并没有用武力埋葬一切，而是在征服的基础上，针对波斯帝国在高墨达事件中所暴露出来的种种弊端，对传统的波斯统治制度进行了一系列的改革，形成了一整套的制度文明，这些都成为波斯帝国赖以进行统治的法宝。<br><br>

其一，大流士对波斯帝国初期粗放式的管理方式进行了变革，将亚述古国的行省制度继承下来，在帝国境内推行崭新的行省制度。他将全国划分为23个行省，由国王任命波斯贵族担任总督。总督只负责行省的政事和司法，并在司库的协助下征收赋税，维持本省治安。每名总督都配有一名直接听命于国王的王室秘书，他直接向国王汇报行省工作，并负责监督官员。行省的军权由国王任命的军官统领，军官、总督和王室秘书互不隶属，都直接听令于国王，互相牵制。多疑的大流士派遣许多眼线监督行省官员的一举一动，若有叛乱，叛乱者的皮就要被剥下来铺在国王的坐椅上，以杀一儆百。喜欢摆排场的大流士学设置了接见使臣和庆典的都城波斯波利斯，夏都哈马丹，冬都巴比伦及春都苏萨四个都城，建立专门连接四都的驿道，一年四季轮流在四个首都发号施令。<br><br>

其二，为密切中央和地方的关系，为了方便军队的调动和国王命令的下达以及下情上传，大流士在帝国境内大修驿道。最长的一条沟通小亚细亚西部的以弗所和首都苏萨，全长2400米，号称“御道”。希腊人羡慕地说：“波斯王住在巴比伦，爱琴海鲜进宫廷”。<br><br>

其三，大流士不仅每年从行省勒索黄金、铸造金砖于皇宫的金库中，还下令统一了帝国的度量衡，制定了铸币制度，规定中央政府铸造金币，称“大流克”，每枚重8.4克，通行全帝国；行省铸造银币；自治市可铸造铜币。大流士还明确制定了各行省向中央缴纳的年贡和实物数额的赋税制度。<br><br>

其四，大流士创建了万人“不死队”、2000骑兵和2000步兵组成的近卫军及以腓尼基为核心的舰队。军队由步兵、骑兵、战车兵、象兵和海军、工兵组成，并把全国分为五个军区进行统治，指挥官多为波斯人。国王每年要对军队进行检阅，边远地区则由国王派人检阅。<br><br>

其五，大流士还灵活调整政策，利用宗教的宽容拉拢被征服地区的上层人物，并尽可能照顾各地征服地区的上层人物，并尽可能照顾各地原有的法律传统，以缓和波斯与被征服地区统治者之间的关系，巩固帝国的统治；大流士还开通了尼罗河至红海间的运河，派斯基拉克调查印度河口以建立印度和帝国的海上联系，在外部形成帝国强大的后方支持者。如此内外兼顾的灵活手腕，使波斯帝国的统治达到鼎盛时期。
<br><br>
谁与评说<br><br>

大流士在波斯帝国危乱之际，挺身而出，力挽狂澜，一路杀伐，终使帝国转危为安；之后，他又锐意改革，奠定了以后波斯帝国延续达二百年的根基。但另一方面，他又同残暴的统治、残酷的征服，血腥的屠杀紧紧相连。显然，大流士建立自己功业的法宝所凭借的是强力的军事征服，一旦失去佑护帝国的宝剑，帝国将辉煌不再。由此看来，大流士也注定只能是历史长河中的过客。因为帝国辉煌的军事征服同时也播下了陨落的种子，大流士逼迫波斯本土的农民奉献给他丰富的礼物，每年对行省大加勒索，靠着对各地人民的残酷压榨，过着极度奢侈的生活。各地人民不满其压迫和剥削，反抗情绪日益高涨，波斯境内的被奴役人民的反抗斗争此起彼伏，从未停止过。最使大流士感到愤怒的就是，发动对希腊的战争屡战屡败。公元前486，埃及爆发了反波斯人统治的起义，大流士还来不及镇压就溘然辞世了。显然，大流士不仅留给后世一个有规可循的波斯帝国，也带给后人无休止的争论。<br><br>





疯狂暴君――冈比西斯<br><br>

他的父亲被亲切地称为“万王之王”，而他则是“恶魔之王”。是癫痫病，抑或是触犯了埃及的神灵，他才如此丧心病狂，暴虐成性？他的死因更是扑朔迷离，成为千百年来未解的历史谜题。他就是历史上的疯狂暴君――冈比西斯。<br><br>

 

“光芒下的阴影”<br><br>

冈比西斯的父亲――居鲁士是历史上著名的君主之一，他用金戈铁马踏平了米底、帕提亚、吕底亚、小亚细亚的各古希腊城邦以及巴克特里亚等中亚许多地区和强大的巴比伦，使波斯从一个伊朗高原西南隅的小邦变成一个庞大帝国。他宽厚大度、睿智多谋，被波斯人亲切地称为“父亲”，是古希腊各邦尊敬的“主人”，犹太人心中永远的“涂圣油的王”和“恩人”，享有“万王之王”的尊号。<br><br>

当时的冈比西斯已经和父亲共治了，在巴比伦担任居鲁士的全权代理人。冈比西斯一直生活在父亲的神圣光环之下，感觉被父亲的万丈光芒遮蔽了，仿佛永远也超越不了父亲的盖世功绩。这些给他带来巨大的心理压力，他甚至妒忌父亲的功绩。有一次他问自己的大臣们：“我和我的父亲居鲁士比起来，你们认为我是怎样的一个人物？”一个善于阿谀奉承的大臣回答说：“冈比西斯，你已经超过了你的父亲，因为你不仅是你的父亲曾经统治过的全部领土的主人，还征服了埃及，控制了大海。”当时的智者洛伊索斯则委婉地夸赞说：“居鱼士的儿子，你是比不上你的父亲的，因为你还没有像你的父亲那样，有你这样一个儿子。”居鲁士听后更加心花怒放。<br><br>

妒忌心强、暴躁冒进、刚愎自用，以及为摆脱父亲的阴影而对建功立业的急切心情都造成了冈比西斯疯狂的行为。<br><br>

梦断埃及<br><br>

即位之后的冈比西斯，终于可以大展身手，建立更大的功勋以超越父亲。公元前525年，冈比西斯急不可耐地开动战争的机器，去征服富庶强大的埃及。关于冈比西斯进攻埃及的原因，古希腊历史学家希罗多德认为是这样的：冈比西斯想娶埃及国王阿玛西斯的女儿为妻。阿玛西斯得知这个消息后，认为冈比西斯不是真心要娶自己的女儿做妻子，因此不想让自己的女儿受委屈。可如果不答应的话，又怕得罪强大的波斯。最后阿玛西斯想到了一个绝妙的主意，他让前任国王阿普里耶斯的女儿尼特提斯代替自己的女儿嫁到波斯，尼特提斯身材修长、美丽动人，非常得冈比西斯的宠爱。但好景不长，有一天，尼特提斯趁着与冈比西斯缠绵之际，就对他说：“国王啊，我看你还不知道阿玛西斯是怎样蒙骗了你呢。他将我乔装打扮，然后把我当作他的女儿送到你这里来。但是，我实际上是阿普里耶斯的女儿。阿普里耶斯原本是他的国王和主人，是他和其他埃及人一同起兵反叛，并且杀死了父王。”听完这番话，不可一世的冈比西斯勃然大怒，决定立即出兵埃及以复仇。<br><br>

冈比西斯的军队穿过一片广袤的沙漠，在尼罗河的培泸昂河口附近与埃及大军展开了激战。双方军队作战都很顽强，尸骨遍野、血流成河，埃及人最终还是失败了。冈比西斯终于实现了征服埃及，使其他民族臣服于他脚下的夙愿。但野心勃勃的冈比西斯并不满足于眼前的功绩，又马不停蹄地去征服埃塞俄比亚，但因准备不足，绝粮而归；另一支派往西瓦绿洲的波斯大军也全军葬于滚滚沙尘之中。祸不单行的是波斯国内又爆发了反波斯的高墨达暴动。焦头烂额的冈比西斯忙着去扑灭国内的暴动时，在途中命丧黄泉。<br><br>

暴虐成性的恶魔<br><br>

冈比西斯的失败与他暴虐的统治、乖戾疯狂的举止激起的天怒人怨有着千丝万缕的联系。<br><br>

冈比西斯性格暴躁、刚愎自用，不时做出疯狂的事情，被他的臣民称为“恶魔之王”。普列克萨斯皮斯是冈比西斯的亲信，他的儿子也获得冈比西斯的重用，担任他的行觞官。有一次，冈比西斯问普列克萨斯皮斯：“波斯人认为我是怎样的一个人？”普列克萨斯皮斯回答说：“国王陛下，他们对于你的所作所为，都是大加称颂的，但是只是说你嗜酒过度。”冈比西斯听后火冒三丈地说：“这到底是你的看法，还是波斯人的看法？”然后他狞笑一声，看着胆战心惊的普列克萨皮斯说，“这样吧，我们来试验一下，波斯人是说了真话还是在说谎。你的儿子现在就站在门庭那里，如果我射出的箭正中他的心脏，那就证明波斯人说的话是没有根据的。”他一边说，一边拉弓射向普列克萨斯皮斯的儿子。那个可怜的孩子应声倒下。冈比西斯还残忍地剖开孩子的肚子，当发现自己的箭正好射中心脏时，高兴得手舞足蹈，大笑说：“你看，我就说我是个完人，是个伟大的君主。”还有一次，冈比西斯因为一些鸡毛蒜皮的小事，活埋了12名波斯贵族。<br><br>

冈比西斯对自己的臣民尚且如此残暴，更不用说对待被征服的民族了。冈比西斯在征服埃及时，活捉了埃及的法老普桑门尼图斯。他让法老和其他埃及人一起坐在城外。然后命令他的女儿和许多出身埃及贵族家庭的千金小姐，身穿破烂的奴隶服装，去用水罐打水。这些自幼饭来张口、衣来伸手的娇小姐们，痛哭流涕地走过她们的父亲身边。冈比西斯还让法老的儿子和其他贵族的儿子，项戴绳索、嘴里衔着马勒，从他们身边走过赶赴断头台。看到儿女们如此悲惨的境遇，法老和大臣们心如刀绞，发出撕心裂肺的哭声，冈比西斯却兴奋得哈哈大笑。<br><br>

冈比西斯征战埃塞俄比亚失利后，正值埃及人在热烈庆祝数年不遇的神灵――阿庇斯神的降临。埃及身穿华服，纷纷走上街头，举行隆重的庆祝仪式。冈比西斯勃然大怒，以为埃及人是在嘲笑他，于是先把告知此事的人处死，然后又让人把这个神带给他看看。原来阿庇斯神就是一头不可能受孕的母牛所生的牛犊。埃及人认为，母牛是因为上苍之火从天而降，才得以受孕生下阿庇斯的。发现所谓的神灵就是一头牛犊时，心情浮躁的冈比西斯拔剑就向牛犊刺过去，但是没有刺中要害，刺到牛的大腿上。于是，他大笑着对埃及的祭司们说：“这就是你们所谓的神？它只不过是个血肉之躯的畜生而已。埃及人只配有这样的神！”他下令将这些无辜的祭怀们鞭打一顿，并且禁止全国庆祝这个节日，否则格杀勿论。<br><br>

与残暴的冈比西斯相比，他的弟弟巴尔迪亚才能出众而又宽厚豁达，得到百姓们的拥护。但嫉妒心强的冈比西斯借口梦见巴尔迪亚在波斯已经登上王位，而且他的头一直触着苍天，派人秘密地把弟弟杀害了。而冈比西斯的妻子(也是他的亲妹妹)，因为说了几句怀念巴尔迪亚的话就被他残暴地杀害了。古希腊历史学家希罗多德记载了两种关于他妹妹死因的版本。据说，冈比西斯和他的妻子在观看一只小狗和小只幼狮相斗，当小狗要被打败时，另一只小狗挣脱链子前去增援，结果两小小狗联合起来打败了幼狮。冈比西斯感到很高兴，可一旁的妹妹却哭了。冈比西斯问她为什么哭泣，她说是因为想到了巴尔迪亚，为什么没有一个人为他报仇。这番话惹恼了冈比西斯，随即处死了她。另一种说法是：有一次，冈比西斯和妻子坐在桌旁，他的妻子拿起一根莴苣，揪去了它的叶子，然后问冈比西斯：“是带着叶子的莴苣好看，还是不带叶子的莴苣好看？”他说：“带叶子的好看。”于是，他的妹妹就说：“可是你把居鲁士这个家族弄得光光的，就好像这根莴苣一样了。”冈比西斯听话勃然大怒，猛扑过去，对已有身孕的妹妹拳打脚踢，结果导致她流产而死。<br><br>

扑朔迷离的死因<br><br>

特殊之人的死亡与常人不同，人们也许是出于对冈比西斯的憎恨，给他的死亡加上因果报应、神灵惩罚的意味，所以关于冈比西斯的死亡有着不同的版本，给力图探寻历史真相的历史学家留下了一个谜团。按照希罗多德的说法，冈比西斯得知高墨达发动暴乱时，非常震怒，他迅速跃到马上，准备尽快赶回波斯去镇压叛乱。但不料他所佩带的宝剑的剑鞘脱落了，猁的剑锋刺入了他的大腿，他受伤的部位恰恰是他自己刺中的埃及人的神祗阿庇斯的那个部位。二十多天后，冈比西斯因伤口感染、骨头坏疽而死。而有些学者根据《贝希斯顿铭文》认为冈比西斯是自杀而亡，还有的人说是被暗杀。究竟冈比西斯是怎么死的，还是留给睿智的读者去评判吧！<br><br>
